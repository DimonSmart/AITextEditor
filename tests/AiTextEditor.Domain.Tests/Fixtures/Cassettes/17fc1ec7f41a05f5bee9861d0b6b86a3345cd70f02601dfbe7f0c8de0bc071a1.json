The user wants me to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the document. First, I need to scan through each item in the current batch. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence with pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but since the task is to find \\\"Фуксии\\\", I should check if any of the current batch items mention that term.\\n\\nLooking at the items provided, none of the paragraphs or list items seem to contain \\\"Фуксии\\\". The text discusses the Moon's cooling process, liquid substance, and some characters like Знайка and Звёздочкин. There's no mention of Фуксии here. The previous evidence pointer might be from a different batch, but the current batch doesn't have any matches. So, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there's no new evidence in the current batch. I need to make sure not to include any pointers from the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 100, but since there are no new matches, the decision remains \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2251,\"completion_tokens\":255,\"total_tokens\":2506}}\n",
