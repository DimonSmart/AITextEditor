The user is asking where in the document it's mentioned that the clothing factory produced everything from rubber bras to synthetic fur coats. The previous steps used a keyword cursor with specific keywords. The tool response shows a paragraph that starts with \\\"И это ещё не всё...\\\" which translates to \\\"And that's not all...\\\" Then it mentions the construction of a clothing factory that produced a variety of clothing, starting from rubber bras and ending with winter coats made of synthetic fibers. The paragraph also talks about machines doing the work and the products being distributed.\\n\\nSo the answer should point to this paragraph. The SemanticPointer provided is \\\"5:1.1.1.p2\\\". The goal is achieved here because the paragraph directly answers the question by listing the range of products the factory made. The stop reason is goal_reached since the information is found. I need to make sure to mention the goal and the stop reason in the final answer.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1672,\"completion_tokens\":283,\"total_tokens\":1955}}\n",
