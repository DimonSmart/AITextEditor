The user wants the first dialogue between two named characters. I tried creating several cursors with different filters, but none found the evidence. Now, I'm using a full-text cursor to scan everything.\\n\\nI need to check each paragraph for direct speech markers like quotes or dashes. Once I find a dialogue, I should identify the characters involved. Since previous attempts didn't find anything, maybe the dialogue is in a less obvious format or the markers are different. I'll keep scanning until I find the first instance where two named characters are speaking. Once found, I'll note their names and the pointer location.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_ab5yr9r4\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"full_text_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first dialogue between two named characters\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2029,\"completion_tokens\":172,\"total_tokens\":2201}}\n",
