I tried creating different cursors with varying filters, but each time it came back as not found. Maybe the dialog isn't in the format I'm expecting. Let me think—perhaps the characters aren't named explicitly in the text, or the dialog is indirect. Alternatively, maybe the first occurrence is later in the document. Since the cursors are returning \\\"more items available,\\\" I should continue iterating. Let me try a more general filter that captures any mention of two named entities in a conversational context, even if the dialog isn't direct. Let's create another cursor with a broader filter.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_zjecohmr\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"Identifies paragraphs with at least two named entities in a conversational context (e.g., 'Alice and Bob discussed...', 'John mentioned to Mary...'), regardless of dialogue format.\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"dialogue_cursor_v5\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1716,\"completion_tokens\":202,\"total_tokens\":1918}}\n",
