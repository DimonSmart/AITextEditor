The user wants the first mention of профессора Звёздочкина, excluding headers. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so we need to find the first occurrence in the current batch.\\n\\nLooking at the batch items, the first entry is a heading, so we can skip that. The next items are headings again, so those are excluded. Then there's a paragraph (4:1.1.1.p1) that mentions \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" in the heading. Wait, no, the heading is \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\", but the task says to exclude headers. So the actual mention in the paragraph content? Let me check the paragraphs.\\n\\nLooking at the paragraphs, the first paragraph (4:1.1.1.p1) starts with \\\"С тех пор как Незнайка совершил путешествие в Солнечный город...\\\" and doesn't mention Звёздочкина. The next paragraphs talk about the city changes, the factory, Ponchik's clothes, etc. None of the paragraph contents mention профессора Звёздочкина. The heading 3:1.1.1 is a heading, so excluded. The next paragraph after that is 4:1.1.1.p1, which is the first paragraph under that heading. Wait, maybe the heading itself is part of the content? No, the task says to exclude headers. So the actual mention must be in the paragraph text. But none of the paragraphs mention Звёздочкина. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\\n\\nWait, the heading 3:1.1.1 is \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\", which is a heading, so excluded. The paragraphs under that heading (4:1.1.1.p1 to p4) don't mention Звёздочкина. So maybe there's no mention in this batch? But the task says to find the first mention. If there's none in the current batch, then the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\". But the user's input has the firstBatch as true, so maybe the answer is that there's no evidence here. Wait, but the user's input might have more batches. However, according to the current batch, there's no mention in the paragraphs. So the newEvidence array would be empty, and the decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there's no evidence yet. Wait, but the task is to find the first mention. If the current batch doesn't have it, then the answer is \\\"not_found\\\" or \\\"continue\\\"? The rules say to output \\\"continue\\\" if there's no evidence, but the user might expect to check further batches. However, the current batch doesn't have any mention in the paragraphs. So the correct decision is \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no evidence in the current batch. Wait, but the user's input might have more batches. But according to the given data, the current batch doesn't have the mention. So the answer should be \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1903,\"completion_tokens\":681,\"total_tokens\":2584}}\n",
