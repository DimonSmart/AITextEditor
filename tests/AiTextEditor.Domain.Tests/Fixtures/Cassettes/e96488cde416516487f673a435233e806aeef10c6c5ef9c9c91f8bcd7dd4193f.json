The user is using CursorAgent to find the first mention of \\\u0022\u041F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A\\\u0022 in a book. The current state is that they\u0027re in the CUR_WHOLE_BOOK_FORWARD cursor, mode FirstMatch. The goal is to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the snapshot, the alreadyFound array is empty, and seenTail has pointers up to Id 7. The progress is continued, and the limits show they\u0027re at step 5 with 123 remaining steps. The batch provided has one item with pointer 7, which is already in seenTail. But the markdown content here definitely mentions \\\u0022\u041F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A\\\u0022 multiple times. \\n\\nSince the mode is FirstMatch, the agent should prioritize the earliest occurrence. However, the current batch\u0027s items start from pointer 7, which is already in seenTail. But the first mention might be in a previous batch that\u0027s not yet processed. Wait, the seenTail includes up to Id 7, but the batch here is step-5, which might be part of the processing. \\n\\nWait, the batch items are part of the current step. The pointer 7 is in seenTail, but the content here has the first mention. However, since the dedup rule says not to return pointers already in seenTail, but the content here is part of the current batch. Wait, the seenTail includes pointer 7, but the batch\u0027s item is pointer 7. So the agent can\u0027t use that pointer again. But the content here is the first mention. However, the pointer is already in seenTail, so according to the dedup rule, it can\u0027t be considered again. \\n\\nWait, maybe the first mention is in this batch\u0027s content, but the pointer is already in seenTail. So the agent can\u0027t use that pointer again. But the content here is the first occurrence. However, the dedup rule prevents using pointers already in seenTail. So the agent can\u0027t use this item. But the user\u0027s goal is to find the first mention, which is in this content. But since the pointer is already in seenTail, the agent can\u0027t process it again. \\n\\nWait, maybe the first mention is in a previous batch that\u0027s not yet processed. But the seenTail includes up to Id 7, which is the current batch. So the agent needs to check if there\u0027s an earlier pointer in the batch that hasn\u0027t been processed. But the current batch\u0027s items start at pointer 7, which is already in seenTail. So the agent can\u0027t use that. Therefore, the first mention is in this content, but the pointer is already in seenTail. \\n\\nThis is a bit confusing. The agent needs to find the first occurrence, but the dedup rule prevents using pointers already in seenTail. However, the content here is the first mention. So maybe the agent should process this content even though the pointer is in seenTail, but according to the dedup rule, it can\u0027t. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the first mention is in a previous batch that\u0027s not yet processed. But the seenTail includes up to Id 7, which is the current batch. So the agent can\u0027t go back. Therefore, the first mention is in this content, but the pointer is already in seenTail. So the agent can\u0027t use it. \\n\\nWait, but the first mention rule says to prefer the earliest matching item in the current batch. So even if the pointer is in seenTail, if the content is the first mention, maybe the agent can still use it. But the dedup rule says not to return pointers already in seenTail. So the agent can\u0027t. \\n\\nThis is a conflict. The content here has the first mention, but the pointer is already in seenTail. So the agent can\u0027t use it. Therefore, the agent needs to continue processing the next batch. But the batch has hasMore: true, so there are more items. \\n\\nWait, the current batch is step-5, and the limits have Remaining: 123. So there are more steps to process. The agent should continue to the next batch to find the first mention. But the current batch\u0027s content has the first mention, but the pointer is already in seenTail. So the agent can\u0027t use it. Therefore, the decision is to continue, and the newEvidence would include this item\u0027s content, but since the pointer is in seenTail, it\u0027s not added. \\n\\nWait, the newEvidence array is for pointers not in alreadyFound or seenTail. Since the pointer is in seenTail, it\u0027s not added. So the agent can\u0027t use this item. Therefore, the agent must continue to the next batch. \\n\\nBut the user\u0027s goal is to find the first mention. If the current batch\u0027s content has the first mention, but the pointer is already in seenTail, then the agent can\u0027t use it. Therefore, the agent must continue. \\n\\nSo the decision is to continue, and the stateUpdate would reflect that. The result isn\u0027t set because the goal isn\u0027t met yet. The needMoreContext is false. \\n\\nWait, but the first mention is in this content. Even though the pointer is in seenTail, maybe the agent can still consider it. But according to the dedup rule, it can\u0027t. So the agent can\u0027t use this item. Therefore, the agent must continue. \\n\\nSo the final decision is to continue, with newEvidence being empty (since the pointer is in seenTail), stateUpdate shows progress continued, and needMoreContext is false.\\n\u0022},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022stop\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:2322,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:131,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:2453}}\n",
