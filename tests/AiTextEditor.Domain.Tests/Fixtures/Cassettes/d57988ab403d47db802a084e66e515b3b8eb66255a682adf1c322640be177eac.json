The user wants the first non-header mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". The context is all paragraphs containing that name, and the max evidence count is 1. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check the current batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence with pointer \\\"3:1.1.1\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch has items 4:1.1.1.p1 and 5:1.1.1.p2. \\n\\nLooking at the markdown of these items. The first paragraph (4:1.1.1.p1) talks about Незнайка's trip and the changes in Цветочный город. There's no mention of профессор Звёздочкин here. The second paragraph (5:1.1.1.p2) discusses the industrial enterprises built with help from Солнечного города. Still, no sign of профессор Звёздочкин.\\n\\nSince neither of these paragraphs contains the required name, there are no new evidence points to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the current batch doesn't have the mention. Also, the user specified to use only the current batch, so even though the snapshot has evidence, the current items don't contribute. Therefore, the answer is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1276,\"completion_tokens\":308,\"total_tokens\":1584}}\n",
