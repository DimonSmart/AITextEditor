The user wants me to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdочкин and describe his character trait of boiling with outrage. Wait, the task mentions \\\"профессор Звёздочкин,\\\" but looking at the provided batch items, I don't see any mention of that name. The items talk about Знайка, Стекляшкин, Фуксия, and Селёдочка, but not Звёздочкин. \\n\\nWait, maybe there's a typo? The user might have meant \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" but the text refers to \\\"Стекляшкин\\\" as an astronomer. Let me check again. The snapshot has evidenceCount 0, so no previous matches. The current batch items don't have any mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин.\\\" All the paragraphs are about Знайка's travels and the lunar craters. There's no reference to Звёздочкин here. \\n\\nSince the task specifies to use only the current batch, and there's no mention of the professor, the decision should be \\\"not_found.\\\" Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 1, but since there's no relevant evidence, the newEvidence array remains empty. So the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1833,\"completion_tokens\":298,\"total_tokens\":2131}}\n",
