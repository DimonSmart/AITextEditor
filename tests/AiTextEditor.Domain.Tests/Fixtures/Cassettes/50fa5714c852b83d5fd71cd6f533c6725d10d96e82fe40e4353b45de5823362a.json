The user is asking for the second mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the book, excluding headers. So first, I need to find all instances where Professor Zvezdokhin is mentioned in the text, not just in headings.\\n\\nI started by creating a cursor called \\\"search_cursor\\\" to search for mentions of Professor Zvezdokhin. Then, I ran the agent to find the first mention. The first result came back with a pointer at 24:1.1.1.p21, which is a paragraph discussing the professor's book. But the user wants the second mention, so I need to continue searching.\\n\\nWait, the response from the tool indicated that after the first run, there's more content. The next pointer is 70:1.1.1.p67, which mentions Professor Zvezdokhin again in the context of a discussion. Then there's another pointer at 79:1.1.1.p76, which seems to be a dialogue snippet. But the user wants the second mention, so after the first one at 24, the next one would be 70. However, the tool's response shows that after running the agent once, the HasMore is false, meaning there are no more results. But the user is asking for the second mention, so maybe I need to check if there's another instance.\\n\\nWait, maybe the first mention is at 24, then the next one is at 70. But the tool's response after the first run shows that the agent found the first mention and then the next ones. However, the HasMore is false, which might mean that the cursor has finished. But the user is asking for the second mention, so perhaps the second one is at 70. Let me confirm. The first mention is at 24, then the next one is at 70. So the answer should be the pointer at 70:1.1.1.p67. But I need to make sure that the second mention is indeed there. The user wants to exclude headers, so the paragraph at 70 is a valid mention. Therefore, the second mention is at 70:1.1.1.p67.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_8zwtesdw\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the second mention of профессора Звёздочкина (исключая заголовки)\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":5826,\"completion_tokens\":525,\"total_tokens\":6351}}\n",
