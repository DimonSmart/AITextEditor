The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin. The user provided a batch of items with pointers and markdown content. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through each item in the current batch. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so no previous matches. The recentEvidencePointers are empty, so no duplicates to avoid.\\n\\nLooking at the items, the first paragraph (pointer 4:1.1.1.p1) mentions \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" in the heading. Wait, no, the markdown for pointer 3:1.1.1 is the heading \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". But the task is about the first mention, not the heading. The actual paragraph content starts at pointer 4:1.1.1.p1. Let me check that. The markdown there talks about Незнайка's trip and the changes in the city, but doesn't mention the professor. The next paragraphs (5, 6, 7) also don't mention him. \\n\\nWait, the heading (pointer 3) is part of the content. The user's instruction says to prefer Paragraph/ListItem content, but headings are part of the markdown. The task is to find the first occurrence. The heading \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\" directly mentions the professor. Since the task is about the first mention, even if it's a heading, it's valid. The evidenceCount is 0, so this would be the first match. The pointer is 3:1.1.1. The excerpt is the heading text. The reason is that it mentions the professor's name. So the newEvidence should include this. Since the task is to find the first mention, and this is the earliest occurrence in the batch, the decision would be \\\"done\\\" because we found the first instance.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2305,\"completion_tokens\":495,\"total_tokens\":2800}}\n",
