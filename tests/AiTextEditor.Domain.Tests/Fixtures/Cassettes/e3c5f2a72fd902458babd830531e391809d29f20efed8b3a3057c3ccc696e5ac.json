The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that we should look for paragraphs with direct speech markers like quotes, dashes, or other indicators. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items:\\n\\n1. The first item (12:1.1.1.p9) is a paragraph about the Moon's surface, but there's no dialogue here. It's all narrative.\\n2. The second item (13:1.1.1.p10) states that astronomers laughed at Znayka's theory. This is a statement, not a dialogue between two characters.\\n3. The third item (14:1.1.1.p11) starts with \\\"Vulcanists said:\\\", which is a direct quote. However, the paragraph doesn't complete the dialogue. It just mentions the vulcanists' reaction but doesn't show a conversation between two named characters.\\n\\nWait, the task requires a dialogue between two named characters. The current items don't have any direct speech that includes two named characters. The only direct speech is \\\"Vulcanists said:\\\", but there's no second character mentioned here. The previous items don't have any dialogues either. \\n\\nSince there's no evidence of a dialogue between two named characters in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The newEvidence array remains empty because none of the items meet the criteria. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and adding nothing new still keeps it at 0, which is less than the maxEvidenceCount of 1. So, the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1085,\"completion_tokens\":372,\"total_tokens\":1457}}\n",
