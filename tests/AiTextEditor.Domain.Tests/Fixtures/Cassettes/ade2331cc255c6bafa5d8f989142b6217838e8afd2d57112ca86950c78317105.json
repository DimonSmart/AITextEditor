The task is to check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different. Then return the names and the dialogue text.\\n\\nFirst, I need to look at the current batch items. The batch has three paragraphs. Let me check each one.\\n\\nFirst item: pointer \\\"78:1.1.1.p75\\\", markdown starts with \\\"От такого бесцеремонного обращения Звёздочкин ошалел настолько, что не мог произнести ни слова. Потом он понемногу пришёл в себя и закричал:\\\"\\n\\nWait, the paragraph starts with \\\"От такого...\\\" which is Russian. The name here is Звёздочкин (Zvezdochkin), but the paragraph doesn't start with the name followed by a colon. It starts with \\\"От такого...\\\" which is a description. Then later it says \\\"закричал:\\\" which is \\\"shouted:\\\" but the name is in the middle of the sentence. So the actual dialogue starts after \\\"закричал:\\\" but the paragraph itself doesn't start with the name.\\n\\nSecond item: pointer \\\"79:1.1.1.p76\\\", markdown is \\\"– Это безобразие! Я буду жаловаться! Я напишу в газету! Вы ещё узнаете профессора Звёздочкина!\\\"\\n\\nThis starts with a dash, which is a dialogue indicator. The text is in quotes, but the paragraph starts with \\\"– Это...\\\" so the dash is like a quotation mark. The name here is mentioned as \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" but the paragraph doesn't start with the name followed by a colon. It starts with a dash.\\n\\nThird item: pointer \\\"80:1.1.1.p77\\\", markdown \\\"Он долго так кричал, размахивая кулаками, но, увидев, что все коротышки разошлись по домам, сказал:\\\"\\n\\nAgain, starts with \\\"Он долго...\\\" which is \\\"He shouted for a long time...\\\" so the subject is \\\"Он\\\" (he), not a specific name. Then \\\"сказал:\\\" which is \\\"said:\\\" but again, the name isn't at the start followed by a colon.\\n\\nWait, the task is looking for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar. So each paragraph should start with something like \\\"Name:\\\" or \\\"Name -\\\" or similar. But in the current batch, none of the paragraphs start with a character's name followed by a colon. Let's check again.\\n\\nFirst paragraph: starts with \\\"От такого...\\\" which is \\\"Such impertinence...\\\" so no name at the start. Then later it says \\\"Звёздочкин ошалел...\\\" which is \\\"Zvezdochkin was stunned...\\\" but the name is in the middle. Then \\\"закричал:\\\" which is \\\"shouted:\\\" but that's part of the sentence.\\n\\nSecond paragraph starts with a dash, which is a dialogue marker, but the name isn't at the start. The name \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" is mentioned later in the text.\\n\\nThird paragraph starts with \\\"Он долго...\\\" which is \\\"He shouted for a long time...\\\" so \\\"Он\\\" is \\\"he\\\", not a specific name. Then \\\"сказал:\\\" which is \\\"said:\\\" but again, the name isn't at the start.\\n\\nSo none of the paragraphs start with a character's name followed by a colon. The task requires consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a different character's name followed by a colon. But in this batch, there are no such paragraphs. So maybe there's no evidence here.\\n\\nWait, but maybe the dash is considered similar to a colon? Like in some contexts, dialogue starts with a dash. But the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So for example, \\\"Name: ...\\\" or \\\"Name - ...\\\". But in the second paragraph, it starts with \\\"– Это безобразие...\\\" which is a dash, but there's no name before the dash. The name is mentioned later in the text. So the paragraph starts with a dash, but the name isn't part of the start. So the start is just the dash, not the name followed by punctuation.\\n\\nSimilarly, the third paragraph starts with \\\"Он долго...\\\" which is \\\"He...\\\" but \\\"Он\\\" is a pronoun, not a specific name. So the name isn't there.\\n\\nSo in this batch, there are no paragraphs that start with a character's name followed by a colon or similar. Therefore, no evidence to report.\\n\\nThe snapshot has evidenceCount 0 and recentEvidencePointers empty. So the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there's more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), and no new evidence found here.\\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"Check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different.\\\" So even if there's one paragraph that starts with a name, but not consecutive, but the current batch might have one, but the task needs consecutive. But in this case, none of the paragraphs start with a name followed by colon. So no evidence.\\n\\nSo newEvidence should be empty. Decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches. Because hasMoreBatches is true, and maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't have a max to reach. So even if we found some, but since there's more batches, we continue. But in this case, no new evidence, so newEvidence is empty list.\\n\\nSo the output should be decision \\\"continue\\\", newEvidence empty array.\\n\\nCheck the rules: Do NOT add evidence for a pointer that appears in snapshot.recentEvidencePointers. But recentEvidencePointers is empty, so no issue. But since there's no matches, newEvidence is empty.\\n\\nYes. So the JSON would be:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\",\\n  \\\"newEvidence\\\": []\\n}\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":804,\"completion_tokens\":1294,\"total_tokens\":2098}}\n",
