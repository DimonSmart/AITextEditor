The goal is to find the first direct dialogue with two named characters in the same sentence. The context mentions examples like \\\"Alice says to Bob: Hello\\\" or \\\"John: Hi, Mary!\\\" So I need to look for direct speech where two named characters are mentioned in the same sentence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, there's only one item with the pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\". The markdown content is a paragraph in Russian. Let me read through it carefully. \\n\\nThe paragraph talks about Знайка (Znayka) meeting Фуксией (Fuksiya) and Селёдочкой (Selyodka), who are \\\"учёными малышками\\\" (scientist kids). Then it mentions Знайка working on the rocket with them and their journey to the Moon. Later, they explore a lunar crater, visit a cave, and conduct observations. The text also mentions that on the Moon, there's no air, so they had to take air supplies.\\n\\nNow, I need to check if there's any direct dialogue here. The paragraph is descriptive, explaining their activities. However, I notice a part where it says: \\\"Знайка и его спутницы принуждены были поскорей отправиться в обратный путь, так как запасы воздуха были у них на исходе.\\\" This translates to \\\"Znayka and his companions had to hurry back because their air supplies were running out.\\\" But this is a statement, not a dialogue. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The paragraph mentions their interactions but doesn't include any direct quotes or dialogues. All the sentences are narrative, describing their actions and the environment. There's no instance where two named characters are speaking directly to each other in the same sentence. \\n\\nSince the task requires direct dialogue with two named characters in the same sentence, and the provided text doesn't have any such instances, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\". The evidenceCount is 0, and there are no new evidence points to add. Therefore, the output should indicate that no evidence was found in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":992,\"completion_tokens\":468,\"total_tokens\":1460}}\n",
