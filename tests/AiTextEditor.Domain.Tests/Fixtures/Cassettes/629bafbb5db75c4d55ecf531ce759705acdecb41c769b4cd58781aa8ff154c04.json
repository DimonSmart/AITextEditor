The user wants to find the first non-header mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through the items in the batch to see if any of them contain that exact phrase.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", the markdown text is about Ponchik and his clothes. I don't see any mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" here. The second item is pointer \\\"7:1.1.1.p4\\\", which also talks about Ponchik's clothes and the moth problem. Again, no sign of the professor's name. \\n\\nSince the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"3:1.1.1\\\", which isn't in the current batch's items, maybe that was from a previous batch. The current batch's items don't have the required mention. Therefore, there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the task is to find the first mention, but it's not present here. Also, the user mentioned that if the maxEvidenceCount is met, set decision to \\\"done\\\", but since we didn't find any, it's \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1292,\"completion_tokens\":281,\"total_tokens\":1573}}\n",
