Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search through the document. The function cursor-create_cursor is the right tool here. The filterDescription should look for mentions of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". Since the user wants the first mention, I should set maxEvidenceCount to 1 to stop early. \\n\\nWait, but the cursor might not have a pointer yet. So I need to first read the document to get the initial pointers. Wait, no, the cursor-create_cursor function requires a filterDescription. Let me check the parameters again. The filterDescription is a stateless per-element filter. So I can use a regex or a simple text match. \\n\\nMaybe the filterDescription can be something like \\\"contains 'профессор Звёздочкин'\\\". But the exact syntax might depend on the system's implementation. Assuming it's a simple text search, I can set the filterDescription to \\\"text includes 'профессор Звёздочкин'\\\". \\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, I'll run the agent with taskDescription to find the first occurrence. The agent will process the document portions and return the evidence items. The first item in the evidence list should be the first mention. \\n\\nI need to make sure that the cursor is created correctly and then run the agent with maxEvidenceCount=1 to get the first mention. Also, the user wants to exclude headers, so the filter should not consider headings. But the cursor's filterDescription might already handle that by checking the text content. \\n\\nSo the steps are: create a cursor with the filter, run the agent to get the first occurrence, then return the pointer and the paragraph where it's mentioned. If not found, inform the user. Let's proceed with the function calls.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_snggz053\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"text includes 'профессор Звёздочкин'\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1070,\"completion_tokens\":444,\"total_tokens\":1514}}\n",
