The task is to find the last mention of \\\"Фуксии\\\" (Fuksiya). The user provided a snapshot with evidenceCount 0 and no recent pointers, so we need to start fresh. The current batch has four paragraphs. I need to scan each item's markdown for any occurrence of \\\"Фуксии\\\" and note the pointer.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (8:1.1.1.p5), there's a mention of \\\"Фуксией\\\" which is the instrumental case. The task is about the last mention, so I need to check all paragraphs. The second paragraph (9:1.1.1.p6) doesn't mention her. The third (10:1.1.1.p7) also doesn't. The fourth (11:1.1.1.p8) mentions \\\"Фуксии\\\" again. Wait, no, the fourth paragraph talks about Знайка's theory but doesn't mention Фуксии. Wait, let me check again. \\n\\nWait, the first paragraph mentions \\\"Фуксией\\\" (dative case), and the fourth paragraph doesn't mention her. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each paragraph again. \\n\\nFirst paragraph: \\\"познакомился с учёными малышками Фуксией и Селёдочкой\\\" – here, \\\"Фуксией\\\" is the instrumental case. The task is to find the last mention. Are there any other mentions? The second paragraph doesn't mention her. The third paragraph talks about the debate between theories but not Фуксии. The fourth paragraph mentions Знайка's theory but not Фуксии. So the only mention is in the first paragraph. But the task says \\\"last mention,\\\" implying there might be more. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. \\n\\nWait, the first paragraph has \\\"Фуксией\\\" (instrumental), and the fourth paragraph doesn't mention her. So the only occurrence is in the first paragraph. Therefore, since there's only one mention, it's the last one. So the newEvidence would be that paragraph. The decision would be \\\"done\\\" because we found the last mention. But wait, the task says \\\"last mention,\\\" but if there's only one, then that's the last. So the answer should include that pointer and excerpt, and set decision to \\\"done\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2088,\"completion_tokens\":605,\"total_tokens\":2693}}\n",
