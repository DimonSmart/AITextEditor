The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdochkin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided the first batch of items. I need to scan through each item's markdown content to see if there's any reference to Professor Zvezdochkin.\\n\\nLooking at the first item's markdown: It talks about Znayka realizing that the walls were made by intelligent beings, leading to the publication of a book about lunar beings called \\\"lunatiki.\\\" The text mentions Znayka's journey and the book he wrote, but there's no mention of a professor named Zvezdochkin here. The paragraph discusses the lunar beings and their structures but doesn't reference any professor. \\n\\nSince the first batch doesn't have the mention, and there are more batches to come (hasMore is true), I should continue scanning. The decision should be 'continue' because the first occurrence might be in a subsequent batch. No evidence found in the current batch, so newEvidence is empty. The decision remains 'continue' as we need to check further batches.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":680,\"completion_tokens\":238,\"total_tokens\":918}}\n",
