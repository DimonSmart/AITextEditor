The previous step already created the cursor, so now I should run the agent to find the first occurrence. Using the agent with maxEvidenceCount=1 to get the first mention. \\n\\nWait, the user wants the first appearance, so stopping after the first evidence item. The response from the tool will give the paragraph where he's first mentioned. Then, I need to check if that paragraph includes his character description. If not, maybe the next item. But since the user specified \\\"first mention,\\\" the answer should be in the first evidence item. \\n\\nOnce found, I'll extract the relevant part, note the pointer, and summarize his character based on the text. If the description isn't there, I'll have to check subsequent items. But the user wants the first appearance, so likely the first item contains both the mention and the description. \\n\\nI should also ensure that the answer is in Russian and include the semantic pointer as required. If the document doesn't have the info, I need to state that. But since the cursor was created and the agent is running, the response should provide the necessary details.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_grjhq8ws\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhinn with his character description\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1150,\"completion_tokens\":343,\"total_tokens\":1493}}\n",
