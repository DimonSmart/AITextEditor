The user is asking about two rotating buildings on Kolokolchikov Street with a spiral descent and a devil's wheel on top. I need to find where this is described in the document.\\n\\nFirst, I'll use the CursorAgentPlugin to run a cursor agent with the task to find those descriptions. The function call was made earlier, and the response came back with a summary. The evidence points to pointer \\\"4:1.1.1.p1\\\" where the description is located.\\n\\nThe excerpt mentions that on Kolokolchikov Street, there are two rotating buildings. The first is a five-story building with a spiral descent and a swimming pool around it. The second is a six-story building with swinging balconies, a parachute tower, and a devil's wheel on the roof. This matches the user's query exactly.\\n\\nSo, the answer should reference the semantic pointer provided in the evidence. The user wants the answer in Russian, so I'll translate the relevant part and include the pointer.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1035,\"completion_tokens\":299,\"total_tokens\":1334}}\n",
