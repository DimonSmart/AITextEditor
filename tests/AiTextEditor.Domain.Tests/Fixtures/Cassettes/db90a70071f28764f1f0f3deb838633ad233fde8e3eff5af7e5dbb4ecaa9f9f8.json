The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the current batch. The task says to scan only the current batch's items and extract relevant evidence. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence, but the recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", which isn't in the current batch. So I need to check the items provided in the batch.\\n\\nLooking at the items, there are three paragraphs. The first one is pointer 66:1.1.1.p63 with the text \\\"– А вы привезли что-нибудь с Луны?\\\" No mention of Фуксии here. The second is 67:1.1.1.p64: \\\"– Я привёз кусочек самой Луны.\\\" Still nothing. The third is 68:1.1.1.p65: \\\"Знайка достал из кармана небольшой камешек голубовато-серого цвета и сказал:\\\" Again, no Фуксии. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. The task's context is \\\"contains 'Фуксии'\\\", but none of the excerpts in the current batch mention that term. The previous evidence was from a different pointer, but since the current batch doesn't have any matches, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the user mentioned to not add evidence if the pointer is in recentEvidencePointers, but since none of the current items match, there's nothing to add. So the output should be decision: \\\"not_found\\\" and empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":717,\"completion_tokens\":367,\"total_tokens\":1084}}\n",
