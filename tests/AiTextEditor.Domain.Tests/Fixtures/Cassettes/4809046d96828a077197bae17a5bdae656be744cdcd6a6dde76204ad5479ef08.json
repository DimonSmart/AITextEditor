The user wants to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to check if the word appears.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", the markdown text doesn't have \\\"Фуксии\\\". The paragraph talks about Пончик and his costumes, but no mention of Фуксии here. \\n\\nNext, the second item with pointer \\\"7:1.1.1.p4\\\". Again, the text discusses Пончик's troubles with moths and the smell from the naphthalene, but I don't see \\\"Фуксии\\\" in there either. \\n\\nSince neither of the paragraphs in the batch contain \\\"Фуксии\\\", there are no new evidence points to add. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and the recentEvidencePointers are empty. But since the current batch doesn't have any matches, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". \\n\\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden mentions. The user mentioned to read the full text, but in both paragraphs, the word isn't present. So the correct output is that there's no evidence found in this batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1272,\"completion_tokens\":280,\"total_tokens\":1552}}\n",
