The task is to find the last mention of \\\"Фуксии.\\\" First, I need to scan through the current batch's items. The user provided a JSON with several paragraphs and headings. The snapshot shows that there were previous matches at pointers \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\" and \\\"70:1.1.1.p67,\\\" but those are from earlier batches. The current batch starts from pointer 74:1.1.1.p71 onwards.\\n\\nLooking at each item's markdown content:\\n\\n- 74:1.1.1.p71 mentions Звёздочкин but not Фуксии.\\n- 75:1.1.1.p72 is \\\"Долой!\\\" – no match.\\n- 76:1.1.1.p73 again mentions Звёздочкин.\\n- 77:1.1.1.p74 same as before.\\n- 78:1.1.1.p75: Звёздочкин again.\\n- 79:1.1.1.p76: Звёздочкин is mentioned, and he talks about writing in the newspaper. Wait, the task is about Фуксии, not Звёздочкин. Maybe there's a typo? Or perhaps Фуксии is a name that's similar? Wait, the user's task is to find the last mention of Фуксии, which is a name. Let me check again.\\n\\nWait, looking through all the paragraphs again. The user's task is about Фуксии, but in the provided batch items, I don't see any mention of Фуксии. The names mentioned are Звёздочкин, Знайка, and others. There's no Фуксии in any of the markdown texts here. The previous evidence pointers from the snapshot might have included Фуксии, but the current batch doesn't have any. Therefore, there's no new evidence in the current batch. So the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the current batch doesn't contain any mention of Фуксии. The user might have a typo, but based on the given data, there's no match here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1471,\"completion_tokens\":493,\"total_tokens\":1964}}\n",
