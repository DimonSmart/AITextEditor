The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. The context is all paragraphs, and the maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't have a limit.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. There are two paragraphs here. Let me check each one carefully.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (pointer 6:1.1.1.p3), the text mentions Ponchik (Пончик) and describes his actions. However, there's no dialogue here. The sentences are narrative, explaining what Ponchik did, but no conversation between characters.\\n\\nMoving to the second paragraph (pointer 7:1.1.1.p4), the text continues the story of Ponchik. It talks about the moths in his home and how the smell affects others. Again, this is narrative. The paragraph mentions that when Ponchik comes to someone's house, the hosts get dizzy and have to open windows. But there's no dialogue between two named characters here either. The interactions are all described from a third-person perspective, not actual dialogues.\\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"dialogue between two named characters.\\\" So I need to look for any part where two characters are speaking. But in the given paragraphs, the text is all narrative. There's no direct dialogue. The only named character mentioned is Ponchik. The other mentions are about the moths and the effects on others, but no other named characters are introduced here. \\n\\nSince there's no dialogue between two named characters in the provided batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found.\\\" The newEvidence array would be empty because there are no qualifying excerpts. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and since there's nothing in the current batch that meets the criteria, we can't add any new evidence. Therefore, the output should indicate that no evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1269,\"completion_tokens\":407,\"total_tokens\":1676}}\n",
