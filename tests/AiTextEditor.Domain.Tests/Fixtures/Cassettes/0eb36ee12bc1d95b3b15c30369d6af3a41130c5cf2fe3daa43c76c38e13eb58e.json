First, I need to check each item's markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer 36:1.1.1.p33, the markdown doesn't have 'Фуксии'. The second item, 37:1.1.1.p34, also doesn't mention it. The third item, 38:1.1.1.p35,同样 no mention. None of the paragraphs or list items in this batch contain the word 'Фуксии'. \\n\\nSince there are no new matches, the decision should be 'not_found'. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include '8:1.1.1.p5', but that's from a previous batch, so it's not part of the current items. Therefore, the newEvidence array remains empty. The decision is 'not_found' because the required term isn't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":845,\"completion_tokens\":229,\"total_tokens\":1074}}\n",
