In current batch, we have three paragraphs. None of them contain \\\"Фуксии\\\". So no new evidence. We must not add evidence for pointers already in recentEvidencePointers. There's a recent evidence pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\". Not in this batch.\\n\\nSo decision: since there are more batches and we haven't found evidence yet (but maybe earlier we had 1 evidenceCount=1, meaning we already have one mention found before). The task wants last mention. We could continue scanning more batches. So decision: \\\"continue\\\". newEvidence empty array.\\n\\nThus output JSON accordingly.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":854,\"completion_tokens\":189,\"total_tokens\":1043}}\n",
