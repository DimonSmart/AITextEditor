The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdochkin in the text, excluding headers. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so we start fresh.\\n\\nLooking at the first batch's items. Each item is a paragraph. Let me check each one for the name \\\"Звёздочкин\\\". \\n\\nThe first paragraph (8:1.1.1.p5) mentions Знайка and other characters like Фуксией and Селёдочкой, but no Звёздочкин. \\n\\nThe second paragraph (9:1.1.1.p6) talks about Стекляшкин, but again, not Звёздочкин. \\n\\nThird paragraph (10:1.1.1.p7) mentions астрономы but no professor. \\n\\nFourth paragraph (11:1.1.1.p8) has Знайка and Стекляшкин, but still no Звёздочкин. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The user's task is about Professor Zvezdochkin, but the text here doesn't mention that name at all. All the characters are Знайка, Фуксия, Селёдочка, Стекляшкин. No Звёздочкин. \\n\\nSince none of the paragraphs in the current batch mention Professor Zvezdochkin, and the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, the newEvidence array should be empty. The decision would be \\\"continue\\\" because there's no match found yet. Also, since the task requires the first occurrence and there's none in this batch, we can't set decision to \\\"done\\\" or \\\"not_found\\\" yet. The user might have more batches coming, so we keep scanning.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2108,\"completion_tokens\":404,\"total_tokens\":2512}}\n",
