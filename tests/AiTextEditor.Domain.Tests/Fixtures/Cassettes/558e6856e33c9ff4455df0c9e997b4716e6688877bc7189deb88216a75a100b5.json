Let me recall the tools I have. There's the CursorAgentPlugin-run_cursor_agent function. I need to use that to search the document.\\n\\nFirst, I should check the parameters required for the function. The taskDescription is needed, which in this case is \\\"Find the first mention of Ponchik.\\\" The function doesn't require context or startAfterPointer, so I can omit those.\\n\\nWait, the user wants the first occurrence in the text, not just any mention. So the cursor agent should look through the document and find the earliest instance. Since the function is designed to run a cursor agent with a task, I'll set the taskDescription to \\\"Find the first mention of Ponchik\\\" and call the function. That should return the relevant paragraph or list item where Ponchik is first mentioned. If the document doesn't have that info, I'll need to inform the user it's not found. But I'll let the function handle the search.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_wbimecv2\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"CursorAgentPlugin-run_cursor_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Найти первое упоминание Пончика\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":351,\"completion_tokens\":251,\"total_tokens\":602}}\n",
