The user wants the first mention of Znayka comparing the lunar surface to pancake and steam bubbles. The context is all paragraphs mentioning 'Знайка' and comparing the lunar surface to pancake or steam bubbles. The maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't need to limit based on that.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, there are three items, all headings. The first is a main heading, then a subheading, and then another subheading. None of these headings mention 'Знайка' in the markdown content. The pointers are 1:1, 2:1.1, 3:1.1.1. The markdown for each is just the heading text. Since the task requires content from the current batch, and none of the items here have the necessary mentions, there's no evidence to report. The decision should be 'not_found' because the required content isn't present in the current batch. Also, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and since there are no new evidence pointers, the decision remains 'not_found'.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":675,\"completion_tokens\":245,\"total_tokens\":920}}\n",
