The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch's items array. \\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", the markdown content is about Ponchik and his clothes. I'll check if 'Фуксии' appears here. Scanning through the text: \\\"Все были очень довольны. Единственным, кто пострадал на этом деле, оказался Пончик...\\\" No mention of Фуксии here.\\n\\nNext, the second item with pointer \\\"7:1.1.1.p4\\\": \\\"От такого обилия шерстяных изделий в доме развелась моль...\\\" Still no Фуксии. The text talks about moths and the smell from naphthalene, but not Фуксии. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The user's task is to find all mentions of 'Фуксии', which is a Russian word. The provided texts are in Russian. Let me look for any occurrence. \\n\\nIn the first paragraph, the characters mentioned are Пончик and others, but no Фуксии. The second paragraph mentions Пончик again, but no Фуксии. \\n\\nHmm, maybe there's a typo or a misspelling? Or perhaps the word is part of a longer phrase? Let me check again. The first paragraph has \\\"Фуксии\\\" spelled correctly? Wait, the user's task is to find 'Фуксии', but in the provided texts, I don't see that word. \\n\\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in the task? Or perhaps the batch doesn't contain any mentions. Since the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, and the current batch also doesn't have any instances of Фуксии, the correct decision would be 'not_found'. \\n\\nSo, the answer should be that there's no new evidence, hence decision is 'not_found' and newEvidence is an empty array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1272,\"completion_tokens\":469,\"total_tokens\":1741}}\n",
