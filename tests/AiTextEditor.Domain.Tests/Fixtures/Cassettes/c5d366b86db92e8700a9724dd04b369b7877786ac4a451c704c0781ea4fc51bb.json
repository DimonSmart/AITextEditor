Это была загадка о том, как выглядит камень, который падает с Луны и оказывается в центре самой Луны.\\n\\n\\u003e **Вопрос:**  \\n\\u003e Что за камень падает с Луны и почему он оказывается в центре Луны?\\n\\n**Ответ:**  \\nКамень, который падает с Луны, — это «крошка» лунного камня, который, как и все остальные предметы, притягивается к центру Луны. Поэтому, когда он падает, он оказывается в центре Луны, а не на её поверхности. Это объясняет, почему в карикатуре Знайка изображён, как будто он «болтается» в центре Луны: камень, падающий с Луны, действительно оказывается в центре, а не на поверхности.\",\"reasoning\":\"We need to answer the user query: \\\"Загадка лунного камня\\\" (Moon stone riddle).
