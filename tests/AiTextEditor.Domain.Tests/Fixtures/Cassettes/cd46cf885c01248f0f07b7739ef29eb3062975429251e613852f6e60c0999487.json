The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context requires paragraphs with direct speech markers and at least two named characters. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items:\\n\\n1. The first item (15:1.1.1.p12) is a paragraph starting with a dash, which might indicate a dialogue. But it's a single line without any named characters. The speaker isn't mentioned here.\\n\\n2. The second item (16:1.1.1.p13) has \\\"Знайка отвечал...\\\" which is a direct speech. Here, \\\"Знайка\\\" is a named character. However, the paragraph is a monologue, not a dialogue between two characters. There's no second character mentioned here.\\n\\n3. The third item (17:1.1.1.p14) starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which again is a direct speech. \\\"Метеоритчики\\\" might be a group or a character name. But it's still a single speaker. No interaction between two named characters here.\\n\\nNone of the paragraphs in the current batch have two named characters engaging in dialogue. The direct speech markers are present, but they're monologues. The task requires a dialogue between two named characters, which isn't found in the provided items. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there's no matching evidence in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":795,\"completion_tokens\":336,\"total_tokens\":1131}}\n",
