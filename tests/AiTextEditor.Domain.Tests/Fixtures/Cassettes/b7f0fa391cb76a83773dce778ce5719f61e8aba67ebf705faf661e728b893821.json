The user wants to find a paragraph describing two rotating buildings on Kolokolchikov Street with a spiral descent and a devil's wheel on the roof. The context includes specific keywords: 'Колокольчиков', 'вертящихся зданий', 'спиральный спуск', and 'чёртовым колесом'.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, all are headings. The first item is a main heading, then a subheading, and another subheading. None of these headings contain the required keywords. The task mentions needing paragraphs, but the current batch only has headings. Since there's no paragraph content here, there's no excerpt that matches the context. The evidenceCount is 0, and the recentEvidencePointers are empty. Since the batch doesn't have any items that meet the criteria, the decision should be 'not_found'. Also, the user might need to check subsequent batches for the actual paragraph content.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":705,\"completion_tokens\":219,\"total_tokens\":924}}\n",
