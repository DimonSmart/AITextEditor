Let me see.\\n\\nFirst, I created a cursor to find dialogue paragraphs, but the first run didn't find anything. Then I tried again with a slightly different filter, but still no luck. Now, the user is showing the response from the second cursor. Wait, the status says \\\"More items available,\\\" so there must be more to process. But the agent-run_agent response says \\\"not_found\\\" with hasMore=true. That means the cursor hasn't exhausted the document yet, but the current batch didn't have the required dialogue.\\n\\nMaybe the filter isn't specific enough. Let me adjust the filter to look for explicit dialogue tags, like \\\"CharacterA: ... CharacterB: ...\\\" or direct quotes. Also, ensure that the filter checks for two named entities in the same sentence. Let me create another cursor with a more precise filterDescription. Let's try again, maybe the first occurrence is in a later portion. I'll set maxEvidenceCount to 1 to stop after the first match. If the cursor finds it, great. If not, maybe the document doesn't have such a dialogue, and I should inform the user.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_yg7xw9v0\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"dialogue_cursor_v2\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Locate the first direct dialogue with two named characters in the same sentence\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1365,\"completion_tokens\":300,\"total_tokens\":1665}}\n",
