The task is to check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different. Then return the names and the dialogue text.\\n\\nFirst, I need to look at the current batch items. The input here has three items, all of type Heading. The pointers are 1:1, 2:1.1, 3:1.1.1, and their markdowns are \\\"# Часть I\\\", \\\"## Глава первая\\\", and \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\".\\n\\nThe task is about consecutive paragraphs starting with character names followed by a colon. But all the current items are headings. Headings usually don't have colons after names in the way dialogue might. For example, a dialogue might look like \\\"Alice: Hello\\\" or \\\"Bob: Hi\\\". But here, the markdowns are headings with # symbols. The third one is \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\" which translates to \\\"How Znayka defeated Professor Zvezdochkin\\\". But this is a heading, not a paragraph starting with a name and colon.\\n\\nThe task says to check for paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon. So the content should be like \\\"Name: text\\\". But in the current batch, all items are headings. The itemType is Heading, so they're not paragraphs. The evidence rules say to prefer Paragraph/ListItem content and ignore headings unless the task explicitly asks for them. The task's goal is about dialogue, which typically would be in paragraphs, not headings.\\n\\nSo, the current batch has no paragraphs. All items are headings. Therefore, there's no evidence here that matches the task. The task requires consecutive paragraphs starting with names and colons. Since there are no paragraphs here, just headings, there's nothing to extract.\\n\\nAlso, the recentEvidencePointers is empty, and evidenceCount is 0. The maxEvidenceCount is null, so no limit. But since there's no matching content in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there might be more batches with actual paragraphs. But wait, the current batch has no relevant items. So newEvidence should be empty. But the decision would be \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), but the current batch has no evidence. So newEvidence is empty list, decision \\\"continue\\\".\\n\\nWait, the output schema requires newEvidence to be a list. If there's no new evidence, then newEvidence is empty. The decision would be \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), but the current batch didn't have any evidence. So the agent should continue scanning next batches.\\n\\nBut let me check the rules again. The decision can be \\\"continue\\\", \\\"done\\\", or \\\"not_found\\\". Wait, \\\"not_found\\\" is when there's no evidence found in the entire process? Or maybe when the current batch has no evidence but there are more batches, so \\\"continue\\\". If there are no more batches and no evidence, then \\\"not_found\\\". But in this case, hasMoreBatches is true, so even if current batch has nothing, we should continue.\\n\\nSo for this batch, since all items are headings and the task is about paragraphs with names followed by colon, there's no matching evidence. So newEvidence is empty. Decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches to check.\\n\\nYes. So the output should be {\\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\", \\\"newEvidence\\\": []}.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":681,\"completion_tokens\":760,\"total_tokens\":1441}}\n",
