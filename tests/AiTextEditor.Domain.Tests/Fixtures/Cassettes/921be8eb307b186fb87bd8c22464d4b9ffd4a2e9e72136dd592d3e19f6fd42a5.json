The user is asking where Professor Zvezdokhin is first mentioned in the text, and they want a brief description of his character, specifically noting that he \\\"kiplied from outrage.\\\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search for mentions of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин.\\\" The previous step already created the cursor, so now I should run the agent to find the first occurrence. The task description should be to find the first mention and describe his character. \\n\\nWait, the user wants the first appearance and a short character description. The cursor is set up to filter mentions of the professor. Using the agent with maxEvidenceCount=1 should get the first mention. Then, I need to check the evidence item's text to find the description. The key part is the phrase \\\"кипел от негодования,\\\" which indicates his temper. \\n\\nOnce the agent returns the first evidence item, I'll extract the relevant paragraph, note the pointer, and summarize his character traits based on the text. If the first mention includes the description, that's the answer. If not, I might need to check subsequent mentions, but the user specified the first appearance. \\n\\nI should make sure to include the semantic pointer in the answer. If the document doesn't have the info, I need to state that. Let me proceed with the agent call.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_oswpco1q\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of профессор Звёздочкин and describe his character trait of boiling with outrage\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1212,\"completion_tokens\":349,\"total_tokens\":1561}}\n",
