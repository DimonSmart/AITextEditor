There's mention of architect Veritubutkin's project, but no Professor Zvezdokhin here. \\n\\nSince the user mentioned excluding headers, I need to check if any of the items in this batch have the professor's name. The excerpt provided doesn't include \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\". The items might be paragraphs, but none of the text here refers to him. \\n\\nThe batch isn't the last one (hasMore is true), so there are more batches to process. Therefore, I should continue scanning. The decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because the first mention hasn't been found yet, and there are more texts to check.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":771,\"completion_tokens\":244,\"total_tokens\":1015}}\n",
