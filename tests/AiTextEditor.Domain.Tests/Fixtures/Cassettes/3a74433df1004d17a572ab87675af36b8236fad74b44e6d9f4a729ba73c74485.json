The goal is to find the first non-header mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин.\\\" The context says all paragraphs containing this name are relevant. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need only one match.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, there are two paragraphs. The first one (8:1.1.1.p5) talks about Знайка's trip to the Moon and mentions scientists like Фуксией and Селёдочкой, but I don't see \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" here. The second paragraph (9:1.1.1.p6) discusses Стекляшкин, an astronomer, but again, no mention of Звёздочкин. \\n\\nWait, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"3:1.1.1,\\\" which might be from a previous batch. But the current batch's items don't have that pointer. The user's input might have a typo or mistake, but based on the given data, there's no mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" in the current batch. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the required evidence isn't present here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1323,\"completion_tokens\":278,\"total_tokens\":1601}}\n",
