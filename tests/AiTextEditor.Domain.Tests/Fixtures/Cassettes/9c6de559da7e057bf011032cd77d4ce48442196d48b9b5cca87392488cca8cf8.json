The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that dialogues are indicated by quotes or dashes. The user provided a batch of items, and I need to scan them for such dialogues.\\n\\nFirst, I'll go through each item in the batch. The first item is a paragraph discussing the Moon's surface, but there's no dialogue here. The second paragraph mentions astronomers and vulcanologists laughing at Znayka's theory, but again, no direct dialogue. The third paragraph starts with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\" which translates to \\\"Vulcanologists said:\\\" but it's just the beginning of a sentence. There's no closing quote or dialogue following it. \\n\\nSince the task requires direct speech between characters, and none of the provided items have quotes or dashes indicating dialogue, there's no evidence here. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and the recentEvidencePointers are empty. Since the batch doesn't contain any dialogues, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1088,\"completion_tokens\":233,\"total_tokens\":1321}}\n",
