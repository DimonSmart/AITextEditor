Let me start by recalling the previous steps. The user first asked about the second occurrence, and I created a keyword cursor with \\\"профессор\\\" and \\\"звёздочкин\\\". The response from the tool was \\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\", which probably means the cursor was created successfully.\\n\\nNow, I need to read the batches from this cursor to find the mentions. Since the user wants the second occurrence, I should process each batch and count the mentions. But wait, the assistant can't use the agent-run_agent, so I have to use the read_cursor_batch function. Let me check the parameters: the cursor name is \\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\".\\n\\nFirst, I'll call read_cursor_batch with cursorName \\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\" to get the first portion. Then, I'll need to keep track of each mention as I go. The answer should include the semantic pointer when applicable. Let me make sure to count each occurrence and stop at the second one. Also, the user mentioned excluding headers, so I need to ensure that the paragraphs found aren't headers. Maybe the headers have specific markers, but since the user didn't specify, I'll assume the cursor already filters out headers. Wait, no—the cursor is based on keywords, so it might include headers if they contain the keywords. Hmm, but the user said to exclude headers, so maybe I need to adjust. However, the previous step used the keyword cursor, which might not account for headers. But the user's initial query was about the book's content, so perhaps the headers are already excluded. I'll proceed with the cursor's results and count the mentions. Let me start by reading the first batch.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_c0aqo27i\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"chat_cursor_tools-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":940,\"completion_tokens\":396,\"total_tokens\":1336}}\n",
