The user wants the first two mentions of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина.\\\" Wait, but looking at the provided batch items, I don't see any mention of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" in the paragraphs. The first paragraph talks about Знайка and his trip to the Moon, meeting Фуксией and Селёдочкой. The second paragraph is about Стекляшкин and the Moon's surface. There's no reference to Звёздочкин here. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"3:1.1.1,\\\" which might be from a previous batch, but the current batch items don't have that pointer. Since the current batch doesn't contain the required mention, the decision should be \\\"not_found.\\\" Also, the user's task specifies to use only the current batch, so even if there's evidence in previous batches, it's not considered here. Therefore, no new evidence is found, and the decision is \\\"not_found.\\\"\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1322,\"completion_tokens\":233,\"total_tokens\":1555}}\n",
