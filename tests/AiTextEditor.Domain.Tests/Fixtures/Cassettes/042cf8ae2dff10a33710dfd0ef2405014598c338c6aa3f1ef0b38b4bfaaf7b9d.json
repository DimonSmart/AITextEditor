The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. The context is all paragraphs, and the maxEvidenceCount is null, so we need to find all such dialogues but since the user wants the first one, maybe we just need the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items. The first item is a paragraph with a question, but it's not a dialogue. The second paragraph starts with \\\"Знайка отвечал...\\\" which seems like a dialogue. Wait, the user mentioned two named characters. In the second paragraph, \\\"Знайка\\\" is speaking, but who is the other character? The third paragraph starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which might be another character. But the first dialogue here is between Знайка and someone else. However, the third paragraph mentions \\\"Метеоритчики\\\" which could be a group, not a named character. The task specifies two named characters, so maybe Знайка is one, and the other is implied in the first paragraph? Wait, the first paragraph is a question, maybe from another character. But the first paragraph doesn't have a named character. The second paragraph has Знайка speaking, but the other character isn't named here. The third paragraph mentions Метеоритчики, which might be a group. So maybe the first dialogue is between Знайка and someone else, but the other character isn't named in the provided text. Wait, the user's task says \\\"two named characters,\\\" so both must be named. The second paragraph has Знайка, but the other character isn't named here. The third paragraph mentions Метеор, but that's a group. So maybe there's no dialogue between two named characters in the provided batch. Therefore, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no evidence of two named characters dialoguing. But wait, the first paragraph is a question, maybe from another character. Let me check again. The first paragraph is a question, but it's not a dialogue. The second paragraph is Знайка answering, but the other character isn't named. The third paragraph is Метеоритчики speaking, which is a group. So no two named characters in dialogue. Hence, the answer is not_found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":789,\"completion_tokens\":501,\"total_tokens\":1290}}\n",
