The user wants the first dialogue between two named characters and their names. I created a cursor to find lines with at least two named characters in a dialogue format. Now, I need to run the agent to get the first occurrence.\\n\\nWait, the cursor was created with the filter for dialogue lines. The next step is to use the agent to process this cursor. The task description should be to find the first dialogue. I should set maxEvidenceCount to 1 to stop after the first match. Let me check the parameters again. The cursor name is \\\"dialog_cursor\\\", task description is \\\"Find the first dialogue between two named characters\\\", and maxEvidenceCount is 1. That should retrieve the first instance. Let me make sure the filterDescription was correct. It looks good. Now, run the agent with these parameters.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_nusclzha\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"dialog_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first dialogue between two named characters\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1130,\"completion_tokens\":220,\"total_tokens\":1350}}\n",
