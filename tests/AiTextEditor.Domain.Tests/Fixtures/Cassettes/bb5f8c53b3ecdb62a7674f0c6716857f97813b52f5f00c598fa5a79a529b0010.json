The user wants me to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the provided batch items. First, I need to scan through each item's markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer \\\"10:1.1.1.p7\\\", the markdown talks about lunar craters and two theories: volcanic and meteorite. There's no mention of Фуксии here. The second item is pointer \\\"11:1.1.1.p8\\\", which describes Znayka's theory about lunar craters resembling pancakes with bubbles. Again, no Фуксии here.\\n\\nWait, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch items don't have any references to Фуксии. The task's context says to look for all paragraphs containing 'Фуксии', but none of the current items mention it. So, there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there are no matches in the current batch. I need to make sure not to include any pointers from the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers. Therefore, the output is \\\"not_found\\\" with an empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1101,\"completion_tokens\":278,\"total_tokens\":1379}}\n",
