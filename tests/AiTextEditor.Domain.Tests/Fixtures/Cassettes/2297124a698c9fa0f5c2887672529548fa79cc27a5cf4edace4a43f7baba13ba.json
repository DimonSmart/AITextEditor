The user wants to find the first mention of Фуксия and Селедочка. The current batch has items with pointers and markdown content. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through each item's markdown to look for these names. The evidence rules say to use only the current batch and not consider previous evidence. Since the snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, there's no prior info to exclude.\\n\\nLooking at the items, the first few are headings, so probably not relevant. Starting from pointer 4:1.1.1.p1, the paragraph mentions Незнайка, Кнопочки, Пачкули Пёстренького, but no Фуксия or Селедочка. Next, pointer 5:1.1.1.p2 talks about Вертибутылкин and Клёпки, still no match. \\n\\nContinuing to pointer 6:1.1.1.p3, there's Пончик, but not the names we need. The next paragraph, pointer 7:1.1.1.p4, mentions Пончик again but no other names. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The task is to find the first mention of both Фуксия and Селедочка. But in the provided batch items, none of the markdown content includes these names. The headings and paragraphs discuss other characters like Незнайка, Кнопочки, Пачкули Пёстренького, Вертибутылкин, Клёпки, Пончик, but not Фуксия or Селедочка. \\n\\nSince the maxEvidenceCount is 1 and the evidenceCount is 0, but there's no mention of the required names, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The newEvidence array would be empty because there are no matches in the current batch. So the output should indicate that no evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2030,\"completion_tokens\":433,\"total_tokens\":2463}}\n",
