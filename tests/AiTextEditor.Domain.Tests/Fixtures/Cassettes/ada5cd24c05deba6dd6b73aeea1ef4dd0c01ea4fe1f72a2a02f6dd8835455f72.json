The user wants to find the second mention of Professor Zvezdochkin, excluding headers. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so we start from scratch.\\n\\nLooking at the current batch items, I need to scan each paragraph and list item for mentions of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\". The first mention would be the first occurrence, and the second is what we need. \\n\\nChecking each item:\\n\\n1. The first paragraph (8:1.1.1.p5) talks about Знайка and his friends, but no mention of Zvezdochkin.\\n2. The second paragraph (9:1.1.1.p6) mentions Стекляшкин, an astronomer, but not Zvezdochkin.\\n3. The third paragraph (10:1.1.1.p7) discusses astronomers in Солнечном городе arguing about the origin of craters. No Zvezdochkin here.\\n4. The fourth paragraph (11:1.1.1.p8) mentions Знайка and Стекляшкин observing the Moon, but again, no Zvezdochkin.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The task is about Professor Zvezdochkin, but in the provided text, the names mentioned are Знайка, Стекляшкин, Фуксия, Селёдочка. There's no mention of Звёздочкин. The user might have a typo, or perhaps the name is different. Alternatively, maybe \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" is a title or a different name. But according to the given text, there's no occurrence of that name. \\n\\nSince the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0 and the current batch has no mentions, the newEvidence array would be empty. The decision would be \\\"continue\\\" because there's no evidence found. However, the user's task says to find the second mention, but if there are none, then the answer is \\\"not_found\\\". Wait, the decision policy says \\\"not_found\\\" only when hasMoreBatches is false and evidenceCount is 0 with no candidates. Here, hasMoreBatches is true, so even if current batch has no evidence, we should continue. Therefore, the decision is \\\"continue\\\" with empty newEvidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2131,\"completion_tokens\":514,\"total_tokens\":2645}}\n",
