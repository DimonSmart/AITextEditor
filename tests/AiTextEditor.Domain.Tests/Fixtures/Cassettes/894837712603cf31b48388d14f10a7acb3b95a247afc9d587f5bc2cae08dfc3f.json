The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the provided batch items. First, I need to scan each item's markdown content carefully. \\n\\nLooking at the first item, pointer 27:1.1.1.p24, the markdown is about a meeting discussing a book by Znaykina. There's no mention of Фуксии here.\\n\\nNext, pointer 28:1.1.1.p25. The paragraph talks about Professor Zvezdochkin's lecture on Znaykina's book. He mentions a mistake regarding bricks and a mountainous rock, then talks about the absence of \\\"коротышек-лунатиков.\\\" Still, no Фуксии here. \\n\\nThen, pointer 29:1.1.1.p26. The markdown starts with Znayka standing up and speaking mockingly. The text mentions \\\"коротышек-лунатиков\\\" again, but again, no Фуксии. \\n\\nWait, the task says to find all mentions of 'Фуксии', but none of the provided items have that term. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", which isn't in the current batch. Since the current batch items don't contain 'Фуксии', there's no new evidence to add. \\n\\nThe decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required term isn't present in the current batch. Also, the user's snapshot shows evidenceCount is 1, but since the current batch doesn't add any new matches, the total remains 1. Since the maxEvidenceCount is 10, but no new evidence is found, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1052,\"completion_tokens\":387,\"total_tokens\":1439}}\n",
