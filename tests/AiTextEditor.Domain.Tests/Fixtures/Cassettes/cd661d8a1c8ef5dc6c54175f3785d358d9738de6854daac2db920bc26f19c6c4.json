The user wants to find the first mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" with \\\"кипел от негодования\\\". The context is all paragraphs mentioning either of those terms. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so no previous matches. The batch has three paragraphs.\\n\\nLooking at each item's markdown:\\n\\n1. The first paragraph mentions Знайка and some lunar stuff, but no профессор Звёздочкин or кипел от негодования. So no match here.\\n\\n2. The second paragraph talks about Знайка again, publishing a book about lunar creatures. Still no mention of the professor or the specific phrase. \\n\\n3. The third paragraph continues the story about the lunar inhabitants. Still no sign of профессор Звёздочкин or the required phrase. \\n\\nWait, none of the paragraphs in the current batch mention \\\"профессьор Звёздочкин\\\" or \\\"кипел от негодования\\\". The task is to find the first mention, but the current batch doesn't have any matches. Since the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0 and there are no new matches in this batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, since there's no evidence to add, newEvidence array remains empty. The user might need to check subsequent batches or confirm if the terms are present elsewhere.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1314,\"completion_tokens\":327,\"total_tokens\":1641}}\n",
