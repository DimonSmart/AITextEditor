The user wants to find the second mention of Professor Zvezdochin, excluding headers. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so we start fresh.\\n\\nLooking at the current batch items, I need to scan through each paragraph and listItem for any mention of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\". Let me check each item one by one.\\n\\nFirst item (8:1.1.1.p5) talks about Znayka and his friends, but no mention of Professor Zvezdochin. Next, item 9:1.1.1.p6 mentions astronomer Steklyashkin but not Zvezdochin. Item 10:1.1.1.p7 discusses lunar craters and astronomers arguing, but again, no Zvezdochin. Item 11:1.1.1.p8 talks about Znayka's theory and observing the moon, but still no mention of the professor.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. All the paragraphs mention Znayka, Stelklyashkin, and others, but the professor's name isn't there. The task says to exclude headers, so maybe there's a listItem that mentions him? Let me check if any items have listItem type. The items provided are all paragraphs. \\n\\nHmm, maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps the professor is mentioned in a different context. But according to the given batch, there's no mention of Professor Zvezdochin. So the answer would be that there's no evidence found. But the user wants the second mention, so if there's none, the decision should be 'not_found'. However, the task says to exclude headers, and the batch items don't have headers. So the correct output is 'not_found' since there's no mention of the professor in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1682,\"completion_tokens\":417,\"total_tokens\":2099}}\n",
