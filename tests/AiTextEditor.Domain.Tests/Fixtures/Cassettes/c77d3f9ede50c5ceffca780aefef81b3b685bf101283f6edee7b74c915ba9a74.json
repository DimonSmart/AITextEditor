The text mentions Steklyashkin observing the Moon and discussing lunar craters. However, there's no mention of Professor Zvezdokhina here. The entire paragraph is about Steklyashkin and the Moon's features. Since the task is to find Zvezdokhina, and this batch doesn't have that name, I should continue scanning. The decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because the first occurrence might be in a subsequent batch.
