The user is asking in which paragraph Ponchik, choosing a darker night, threw his old costumes into Ogurcovna River. \\n\\nFirst, I need to find the relevant part of the text. The assistant already created a cursor to search for paragraphs mentioning Ponchik and Ogurcovna River. Then they ran the agent to find the first mention. The response came back with evidence pointing to paragraph 6:1.1.1.p3. The excerpt there says that Ponchik tied his old costumes into a big knot, took them out secretly, and dumped them into the Ogurcovna River. The reason given is that the costumes were out of fashion.\\n\\nSo the answer should be the pointer label from that evidence. The user wants the paragraph where this happened. The pointer is 6:1.1.1.p3, so the answer is that paragraph. Need to make sure there's no other mention, but since the cursor is set to find the first occurrence and the status says more items are available, but the user is asking for the specific instance mentioned. The answer is in that paragraph.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1765,\"completion_tokens\":311,\"total_tokens\":2076}}\n",
