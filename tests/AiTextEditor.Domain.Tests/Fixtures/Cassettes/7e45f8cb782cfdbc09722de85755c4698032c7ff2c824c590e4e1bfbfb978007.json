I need to find the specific part of the text that talks about this.\\n\\nFirst, I created a cursor named \\\"search_cursor\\\" with a filter looking for the keywords the user mentioned. The filter includes terms like 'всё подряд', 'резиновые лифчики', and 'синтетическое волокно'. The cursor was set to read the document in portions, filtering each part as it goes.\\n\\nNow, the response from the tool indicates that the cursor was created successfully. The next step is to run the agent on this cursor to find the first mention. The agent will process the document portions, checking each one against the filter. Since the user wants the first occurrence, I'll set the maxEvidenceCount to 1 to stop after finding the first relevant paragraph.\\n\\nI need to make sure that the agent's task description clearly states finding the first mention. The cursor will stream the document, and the agent will return the first evidence item that matches the filter. Once found, the pointer label and the relevant paragraph will be provided in the response. If the paragraph contains multiple mentions, I have to check if the first mention is there. If not, continue iterating. But since the user asked for the first mention, stopping at the first matching paragraph should suffice.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_vsoh0ios\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of the factory producing rubber bras and synthetic fur coats\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1173,\"completion_tokens\":342,\"total_tokens\":1515}}\n",
