The user is asking where in the book the professor Zvezdokhin is first mentioned. I tried using the QueryCursor function to find the first occurrence, but it resulted in an error. Then I tried MapCursor with a similar instruction, which also failed. \\n\\nHmm, maybe the issue is that the initial cursor creation didn\u0027t have the right parameters. Let me check. The first step was creating a cursor with the default settings. Maybe the maxElements or maxBytes is too low, causing the cursor to not process enough data. Or perhaps the includeText parameter is set to true, but the actual text isn\u0027t being retrieved properly.\\n\\nWait, the user\u0027s question is about the first mention, so maybe I need to adjust the cursor to scan the entire book. The UseWholeBookCursor function might be better here. Let me try that. If I use UseWholeBookCursor with forward set to true, it should process the entire book in chunks. Then, using GetNextPortion to go through each portion and check for the mention.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the QueryCursor or MapCursor functions require a different approach. Let me try creating a new cursor with a higher maxElements to ensure all data is processed. Or maybe the initial search term is incorrect. Let me confirm the exact name: \u0027\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027. Maybe there\u0027s a typo or alternate spelling.\\n\\nWait, the user might have a book where the name is mentioned in a specific context. Let me try using the MapCursor again but with a more specific instruction, like checking each portion for the exact phrase and returning the pointer. If that still fails, perhaps the error is due to the cursor not being properly initialized. Let me try creating the cursor again with adjusted parameters, ensuring that the includeText is true and maxElements is sufficient. Then use GetNextPortion to process each part step by step until the mention is found.\\n\u0022,\u0022tool_calls\u0022:[{\u0022id\u0022:\u0022call_husjimgt\u0022,\u0022index\u0022:0,\u0022type\u0022:\u0022function\u0022,\u0022function\u0022:{\u0022name\u0022:\u0022NavigationPlugin-UseWholeBookCursor\u0022,\u0022arguments\u0022:\u0022{\\\u0022forward\\\u0022:true,\\\u0022includeText\\\u0022:true,\\\u0022maxBytes\\\u0022:2048,\\\u0022maxElements\\\u0022:20}\u0022}}]},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022tool_calls\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:1069,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:449,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:1518}}\n",
