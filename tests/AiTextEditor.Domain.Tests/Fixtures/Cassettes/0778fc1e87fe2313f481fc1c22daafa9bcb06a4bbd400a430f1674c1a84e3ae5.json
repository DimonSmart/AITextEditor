The user wants to know where in the book the professor Zvezdochkin is first mentioned, excluding headers. First, I need to figure out the right approach.\\n\\nThe user provided tools, so I should use them. The goal is to find the first mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" in the document. Since the user mentioned excluding headers, I need to make sure the cursor doesn't include headings. \\n\\nLooking at the tools, there's a keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor function. That seems suitable for searching for keywords. The keywords should be \\\"профессор\\\" and \\\"Звёздочкин\\\". Wait, but the user wants the first mention, so maybe I should use a cursor that filters for those keywords and then read the batches until I find the first occurrence.\\n\\nWait, the keyword_cursor will return all paragraphs containing any of the keywords. But since the user wants the first mention, I need to read the batches in order and find the earliest one. Also, the cursor should not include headings, so I need to set includeHeadings to false. \\n\\nSo the steps would be: create a keyword cursor with keywords \\\"профессор\\\" and \\\"Звёздочкин\\\", includeHeadings set to false. Then read batches from that cursor until I find the first matching paragraph. \\n\\nWait, but the user's plan says to use the keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor first. Let me check the parameters. The keywords array should have the stems. \\\"профессор\\\" is already a stem, and \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" might have different forms, but since it's a proper noun, maybe it's better to use the exact term. \\n\\nSo, create the keyword cursor with keywords [\\\"профессор\\\", \\\"Звёздочкин\\\"], includeHeadings false. Then read batches from that cursor. The first batch that matches would be the first mention. \\n\\nBut the user's plan says to use the keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor, then read batches. So I should start by creating that cursor. Then read each batch until I find the first occurrence. \\n\\nI need to make sure that the cursor is set up correctly. The function parameters for keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor include keywords as an array and includeHeadings as false. \\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, using read_cursor_batch will get the next portion. Each batch will have the paragraphs that match the keywords. The first one encountered would be the first mention. \\n\\nSo the first tool call should be keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor with the keywords and includeHeadings false. Then read the batches until the answer is found.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_dgyy6jw6\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"includeHeadings\\\":false,\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"профессор\\\",\\\"звёздочкин\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1168,\"completion_tokens\":585,\"total_tokens\":1753}}\n",
