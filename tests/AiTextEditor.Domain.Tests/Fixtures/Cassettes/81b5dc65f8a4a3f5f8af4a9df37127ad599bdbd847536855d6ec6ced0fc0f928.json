The user is asking where in the document it's described how astronomers in Solar City got into a fight and split into volcanologists and meteoritologists. \\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out how to approach this. The user mentioned using the tools provided, so I should use the cursor-create_cursor function to create a cursor that filters for mentions related to the conflict. The previous assistant created a cursor named \\\"conflict_cursor\\\" with a filter description about astronomers in Solar City arguing and splitting into the two groups. The response from the tool was \\\"conflict_cursor\\\", which probably means the cursor was created successfully.\\n\\nNow, the next step is to run the agent on this cursor to find the relevant evidence. The agent-run_agent function requires the cursor name and a task description. The task here is to find the description of the conflict between the astronomers. So, I'll set up the agent to look for the first mention of this event. Using maxEvidenceCount=1 to get the first occurrence. \\n\\nWait, the user might need the exact paragraph where this is described. So after running the agent, I should check the evidence items returned. If the first item contains the description, then I can extract the pointer and the text. If not, I might need to adjust the filter or check more items. But since the user wants the first mention, stopping at the first evidence item makes sense. \\n\\nAlso, I need to make sure that the answer is in Russian and include the semantic pointer if applicable. If the document doesn't have the information, I should state that it's not found. Let me structure the tool call correctly with the cursor name and task description, then process the response.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_ehqnh7cz\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"conflict_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the description of astronomers in Solar City arguing and splitting into volcanologists and meteoritologists\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1216,\"completion_tokens\":406,\"total_tokens\":1622}}\n",
