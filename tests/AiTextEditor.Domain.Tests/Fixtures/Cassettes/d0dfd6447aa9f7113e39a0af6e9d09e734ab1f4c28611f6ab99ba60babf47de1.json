The user wants to find the first mention of a clothing factory producing rubber bras and synthetic fur coats. The context is paragraphs mentioning 'одёжная фабрика' (clothing factory) and listing products from rubber bras to synthetic fur coats.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check the current batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence with pointer \\\"5:1.1.1.p2\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch has two items: pointers 8:1.1.1.p5 and 9:1.1.1.p6. \\n\\nLooking at the markdown content of these items. The first paragraph (8:1.1.1.p5) talks about Znayka visiting the Sun City, meeting scientists, and a rocket trip to the Moon. There's no mention of a clothing factory or any products. The second paragraph (9:1.1.1.p6) discusses the Moon's surface, craters, and geological features. Again, no mention of a factory or the specified products.\\n\\nSince neither of the current batch items contains 'одёжная фабрика' or the listed products, there's no new evidence here. The user's task requires finding the first mention, but the current batch doesn't have that. Also, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"5:1.1.1.p2\\\", which isn't in the current batch. So, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no relevant evidence in the current batch items.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1333,\"completion_tokens\":345,\"total_tokens\":1678}}\n",
