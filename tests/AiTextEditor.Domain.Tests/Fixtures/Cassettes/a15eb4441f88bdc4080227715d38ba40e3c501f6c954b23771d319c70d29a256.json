The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. The context mentions paragraphs with named characters in dialogue format. The user provided a batch of three paragraphs from a story involving Знайка (Znayka) and лунатики (lunatiks). \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan each paragraph for any dialogue. The first paragraph (21:1.1.1.p18) is a narrative about Znayka's observations on the Moon. There's no dialogue here, just descriptions. The second paragraph (22:1.1.1.p19) mentions Znayka publishing a book about the lunatiks, but again, no direct dialogue between characters. The third paragraph (23:1.1.1.p20) continues the narrative about the lunatiks moving inside the Moon. \\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"dialogue between two named characters.\\\" The story here is third-person narrative, not a dialogue. There's no direct conversation between two characters. The only named character is Znayka, and the lunatiks are mentioned as a group. So there's no dialogue to report. \\n\\nSince there's no dialogue found in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found.\\\" The newEvidence array remains empty. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and since there are no new matches, the output is \\\"not_found.\\\"\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1288,\"completion_tokens\":319,\"total_tokens\":1607}}\n",
