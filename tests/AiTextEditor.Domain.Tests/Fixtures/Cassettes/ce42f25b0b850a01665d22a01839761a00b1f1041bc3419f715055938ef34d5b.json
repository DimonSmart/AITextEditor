The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that dialogues are indicated by quotes or dashes. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so we need to look through the current batch items.\\n\\nLooking at the first item, pointer 10:1.1.1.p7. The markdown here talks about astronomers arguing about lunar craters, splitting into two groups. But there's no direct dialogue here; it's more of a narrative describing their debate. No quotes or dashes indicating speech between characters.\\n\\nNext, the second item, pointer 11:1.1.1.p8. This paragraph mentions Znayka and Steklyashkin observing the Moon. The text says they were looking through a telescope, and Znayka notices the lunar surface resembling a pancake. However, there's no dialogue here either. It's a description of their observation without any direct speech between them.\\n\\nWait, the task says to look for dialogues between named characters. The characters mentioned are Znayka and Steklyashkin. But in the provided text, there's no actual dialogue. The paragraph describes their actions and observations but doesn't include any direct speech. The user might be expecting a dialogue, but based on the given text, there's none. \\n\\nSince the evidenceCount is 0 and the maxEvidenceCount is 1, but no dialogues are found in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The newEvidence array would be empty because there are no qualifying excerpts. So the output should indicate that no evidence was found in this batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1101,\"completion_tokens\":354,\"total_tokens\":1455}}\n",
