The user wants the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item's markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item (39:1.1.1.p36), the text talks about the Moon cooling from the surface, but there's no mention of Пончик here. The second item (40:1.1.1.p37) has a dialogue about the Moon's molten state, still no Пончик. The third item (41:1.1.1.p38) continues the discussion about the liquid inside the Moon. None of these paragraphs mention Пончик. \\n\\nWait, the snapshot shows that evidenceCount is 1, and the recentEvidencePointers include \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". But that's from a previous batch. The current batch doesn't have any items with Пончик. So, there's no new evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the current batch doesn't contain the required mention. Also, the user's task is to find the first mention, but in the current batch, there's nothing. So the answer is that no evidence was found in this batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":858,\"completion_tokens\":276,\"total_tokens\":1134}}\n",
