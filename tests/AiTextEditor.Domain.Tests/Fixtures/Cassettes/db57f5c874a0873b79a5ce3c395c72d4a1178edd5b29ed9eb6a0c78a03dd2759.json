The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdochin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided a batch of paragraphs. I need to scan each item's markdown content for any reference to Professor Zvezdochin.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (pointer 8:1.1.1.p5), the text mentions Znayka and other characters like Fuxiya and Selyodka. No mention of a professor here. The next paragraph (9:1.1.1.p6) talks about Znayka returning and meeting astronomer Steklyashkin. Still no professor. The third paragraph (10:1.1.1.p7) discusses astronomers in the Solar City arguing about the origin of lunar craters, but the names mentioned are astronomers, not a professor. The fourth paragraph (11:1.1.1.p8) continues the discussion but again doesn't mention a professor. \\n\\nNone of the paragraphs in this batch mention Professor Zvezdochin. The task says to exclude headers, and these are all paragraphs. Since there's no mention, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" only if there are no more batches. But the snapshot shows hasMoreBatches is true, so we need to continue scanning. Therefore, the correct decision is \\\"continue\\\" because the first occurrence might be in a subsequent batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1783,\"completion_tokens\":306,\"total_tokens\":2089}}\n",
