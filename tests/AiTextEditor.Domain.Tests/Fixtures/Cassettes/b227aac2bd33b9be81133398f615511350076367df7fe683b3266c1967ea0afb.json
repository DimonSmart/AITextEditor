The user wants the last mention of \\\"Фуксии\\\". I created a cursor to find all instances, and the first run found one mention in pointer 8:1.1.1.p5. Then, when I tried again with maxEvidenceCount=10, it said no new evidence but more items available. That suggests there might be more mentions, but the agent isn't finding them. Maybe the filter isn't capturing all occurrences. Alternatively, perhaps the document has multiple mentions, but the cursor is not scanning thoroughly. I need to check if there's another mention beyond the first one. Since the status says more items are available, I should continue running the agent until it either finds more or confirms there are none left. Let me try running the agent again without the maxEvidenceCount limit to ensure all mentions are covered.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_rimzaj7o\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find all mentions of 'Фуксии'\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1225,\"completion_tokens\":215,\"total_tokens\":1440}}\n",
