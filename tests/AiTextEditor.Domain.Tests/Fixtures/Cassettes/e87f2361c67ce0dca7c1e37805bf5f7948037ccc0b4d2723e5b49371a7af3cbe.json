Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to find all instances where Professor Zvezdokhin is mentioned in the text. Since the user wants the second occurrence, I should create a cursor to search for these mentions. The function mcp-create_cursor seems appropriate here. I'll set the description to look for mentions of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" and name the cursor something like \\\"search_cursor\\\".\\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, I'll use mcp-run_agent to iterate through the document. The task description should be to find the first mention. Then, I'll need to check the results. If the first mention is found, I'll run the agent again to find the next one. Each time, I'll have to process the evidence items and look for the mentions in the text, not just the headings.\\n\\nI need to be careful because a single paragraph might contain multiple mentions. So, after finding the first mention, the next one could be in the same or a subsequent paragraph. I'll have to keep track of the pointers and ensure that I'm not counting headers as mentions. Also, if the first run doesn't find anything, I might need to adjust the search parameters or check if there's a second mention in a different part of the document.\\n\\nIf the second mention is found, I'll need to return the relevant paragraph along with the semantic pointer. If not, I'll inform the user that it's not found. I should also make sure to stop iterating once the second mention is located to avoid unnecessary processing.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_h6m1lskm\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"description\\\":\\\"Mentions of профессора Звёздочкина (excluding headers)\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":811,\"completion_tokens\":387,\"total_tokens\":1198}}\n",
