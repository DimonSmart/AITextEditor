The user wants to find the first mention of \\\"Fuchs\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to check if \\\"Fuchs\\\" appears anywhere in the markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer 21:1.1.1.p18, the markdown is in Russian and talks about Znayka and lunar craters. No mention of Fuchs here. The second item, 22:1.1.1.p19, also in Russian, discusses Znayka's book about lunar inhabitants. Still no Fuchs. The third item, 23:1.1.1.p20, continues the story about the lunar inhabitants moving inside the moon. Again, no Fuchs.\\n\\nSince none of the items in the current batch mention Fuchs, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The newEvidence array will be empty because there are no relevant pointers. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but that's from a previous batch, so it's not considered here. The task's maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't need to check for a count. Therefore, the correct output is to indicate that no new evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1286,\"completion_tokens\":287,\"total_tokens\":1573}}\n",
