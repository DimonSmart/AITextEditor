The user is asking about the location in the book where the \\\"visualization of a lunar crater as a huge round field with an earth embankment on the edge\\\" is described. \\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the exact terms used. The key elements here are \\\"lunar crater,\\\" \\\"huge round field,\\\" and \\\"earth embankment on the edge.\\\" The user wants to know where this specific description is found in the document.\\n\\nSince I can't use external knowledge, I must rely on the tools provided. The available function is run_cursor_agent, which helps find specific content in the document. The function requires a taskDescription, and optionally context and startAfterPointer. \\n\\nThe taskDescription should be a concise instruction for the cursor agent. The user's query is about locating a specific visualization, so the task should be to find the paragraph that mentions a lunar crater described as a huge round field with an earth embankment. \\n\\nI need to make sure the function is called with the correct parameters. Since there's no prior context mentioned, I'll omit the context parameter. The startAfterPointer isn't specified either, so I'll leave that out. The taskDescription should clearly state the goal: \\\"Find the paragraph describing the visualization of a lunar crater as a huge round field with an earth embankment on the edge.\\\"\\n\\nOnce the function is called, the cursor agent will search the document for the first occurrence of this description. If found, the summary will include the pointerLabel and pointer. If not, the response should state that it's not found in the document.\\n\\nI should also remember to stop as soon as the relevant paragraph is found, without iterating through the entire document. The answer needs to be in Russian and include the semantic pointer if applicable.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_geg1c76m\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"CursorAgentPlugin-run_cursor_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Найти абзац, описывающий визуализацию лунного кратера как огромного круглого поля с земляным валом по краю\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":376,\"completion_tokens\":432,\"total_tokens\":808}}\n",
