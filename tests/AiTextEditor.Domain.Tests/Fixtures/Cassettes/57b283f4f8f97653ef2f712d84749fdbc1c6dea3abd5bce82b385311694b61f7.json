The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters and state their names. The snapshot shows that there are already 2 pieces of evidence, but the recent pointers are 29:1.1.1.p26 and 37:1.1.1.p34. However, the current batch starts from pointer 74:1.1.1.p71 onwards. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the current batch's items to find any dialogues where two characters are mentioned by name. The rules say to use only the current batch's content and not consider previous evidence pointers. The recent pointers from the snapshot might be from earlier batches, so I should ignore them here.\\n\\nLooking at the items in the current batch:\\n\\n- Pointer 74: The paragraph mentions Звёздочкин being dragged out, but no dialogue here.\\n- Pointer 75: The word \\\"Долой!\\\" is shouted, but it's a single exclamation, not a dialogue between two named characters.\\n- Pointer 76: Two corncobbers (коротышек) are mentioned, but they aren't named. The dialogue here is between them and Звёздочкин, but the corncobbers aren't named.\\n- Pointer 77: The dialogue is between Звёздочкин and the corncobbers, but again, the corncobbers aren't named.\\n- Pointer 78: Звёнящий (maybe a typo for Звёздочкин?) is mentioned, but it's unclear. The dialogue here is Звёздочкин shouting, but no other named character.\\n- Pointer 79: Звёздочкин is shouting about complaining, but no other named character.\\n- Pointer 80: He continues shouting, but no dialogue with another named character.\\n- Pointer 81: He declares the meeting closed, but again, no other named character.\\n- Pointer 82: He leaves, but no dialogue.\\n- Pointer 83: Heading, not relevant.\\n- Pointer 84: Heading, not relevant.\\n- Pointer 85: The paragraph mentions Знайка in a caricature, but it's part of a description, not a dialogue. The other characters mentioned are the corncobbers, but they aren't named.\\n\\nWait, in pointer 85, there's a mention of Знайка (Znayka) in the caricature. But the task is about a dialogue between two named characters. The only named characters mentioned in the current batch are Звёздочкин and Знайка. However, in the current batch, the dialogue between them isn't present. The previous evidence pointers (from the snapshot) might have included dialogues between them, but since the user is processing the current batch, maybe there's a dialogue here that I missed.\\n\\nWait, looking again: In pointer 79, Звёздочкин is shouting about writing to the newspaper, and in pointer 85, there's a mention of Знайка in the caricature. But there's no direct dialogue between them in the current batch. The only dialogue is between Звёздочкин and the corncobbers, but the corncobbers aren't named. \\n\\nHmm, maybe there's no new evidence in the current batch. The user's task is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. Since the previous evidence pointers (from the snapshot) are 29 and 37, which are from earlier batches, but the current batch doesn't have any new dialogues between named characters. Therefore, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no new evidence in the current batch that meets the criteria. Alternatively, if there's a dialogue between Звёздочкин and Знайка in the current batch, but I don't see it. The only mention of Знайка is in the caricature description, not in a dialogue. So, the answer would be \\\"not_found\\\" as there's no new evidence here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1493,\"completion_tokens\":875,\"total_tokens\":2368}}\n",
