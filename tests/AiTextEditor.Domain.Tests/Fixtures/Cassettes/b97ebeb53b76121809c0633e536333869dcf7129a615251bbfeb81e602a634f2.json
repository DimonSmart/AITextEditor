The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhina in the text, excluding headers. The user provided the first batch of items. Let me check each item.\\n\\nThe first item is a heading \\\"# Часть I\\\" – that's a header, so we skip it. The second item is \\\"## Глава первая\\\" which is also a header, so again, skip. The third item is \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". This is a heading too, but the markdown shows \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" which is the professor's name. However, the task says to exclude headers. Wait, the user mentioned \\\"исключая заголовки\\\" which means excluding headers. So even though this heading contains the name, since it's a header, we shouldn't count it. \\n\\nBut wait, maybe the actual mention is in the content, not the headers. However, in this batch, all items are headers. The user said \\\"исключая заголовки\\\", so the first occurrence in the text (not headers) is needed. Since the current batch only has headers, there's no evidence here. The decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there's more batches to come. The newEvidence array is empty because the current batch doesn't have any non-header mentions. So the JSON should have decision \\\"continue\\\" and empty newEvidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":468,\"completion_tokens\":315,\"total_tokens\":783}}\n",
