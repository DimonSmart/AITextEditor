The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the provided batch. First, I need to scan each item's markdown content carefully. \\n\\nLooking at the first item, pointer 24:1.1.1.p21, the markdown talks about a book by Знайкина and mentions Professor Звёздочкин's reaction. But I don't see 'Фуксии' here. The second item, 25:1.1.1.p22, discusses the academic discussion about the book. Still no mention. The third item, 26:1.1.1.p23, describes the setup of the discussion. Again, no 'Фуксии'.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first item's markdown mentions \\\"чёртова чепуха\\\" but that's not related. The second item has \\\"разобрать её, как он выразился, по косточкам\\\" – still nothing. The third item's markdown starts with the professor entering the hall. No 'Фуксии' anywhere. \\n\\nHmm, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch items don't have any mention of 'Фуксии'. So, there's no new evidence here. The decision should be 'not_found' since none of the current batch items contain the term. I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden mentions. Let me scan each paragraph again. Nope, nothing. So the answer is that there are no new evidence points in this batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1131,\"completion_tokens\":370,\"total_tokens\":1501}}\n",
