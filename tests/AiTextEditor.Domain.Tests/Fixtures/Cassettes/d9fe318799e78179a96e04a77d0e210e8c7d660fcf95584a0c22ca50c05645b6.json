The goal is to find the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The context specifies that we need paragraphs with dialogue markers mentioning both Znayka and Professor. \\n\\nFirst, I'll look through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence with pointer \\\"30:1.1.1.p27\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch has items 33, 34, 35.\\n\\nStarting with pointer 33:1.1.1.p30. The markdown here is \\\"– При чём тут ещё состояние невесомости? – буркнул профессор.\\\" This is the professor speaking, not Znayka, so it doesn't fit.\\n\\nNext, pointer 34:1.1.1.p31. The markdown starts with \\\"– А вот при чём, – сказал Знайка.\\\" Here, Znayka is speaking. The dialogue mentions the state of weightlessness and the water in the bottle. However, the task is about Znayka commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. This paragraph doesn't mention the Moon or the professor's situation there. It's about water behavior in microgravity. So this doesn't match.\\n\\nThen, pointer 35:1.1.1.p32: \\\"– Попал пальцем в небо! – сердито проворчал Звёздочкин. – Сравнил бутылку с планетой! По-вашему, это научно?\\\" This is Zvёzdочкиn speaking, not Znayka. So no match here either.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. The task says \\\"sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center.\\\" The existing evidence in the snapshot was from a previous batch, but the current batch's items don't mention the Moon or the professor's stuck situation. The only dialogue from Znayka is in p31, but that's about the water in the bottle, not the professor's location. \\n\\nSo, there's no mention of the Moon's center or the professor being stuck there in the current batch. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there's no new evidence in the current batch that matches the task criteria. The existing evidence from the snapshot might be from a previous batch, but the current batch doesn't add any new relevant pointers. Hence, the answer is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1011,\"completion_tokens\":571,\"total_tokens\":1582}}\n",
