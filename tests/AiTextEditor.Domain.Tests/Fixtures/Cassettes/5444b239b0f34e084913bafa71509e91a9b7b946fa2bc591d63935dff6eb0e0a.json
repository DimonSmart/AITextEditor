The task is to find a paragraph where Ponchik chooses a darker night and drowns his old clothes in the Ogurcovna River. First, I need to scan through the provided batch items to see if any of them mention Ponchik, a dark night, and the Ogurcovna River.\\n\\nLooking at the pointers, the first one is 23:1.1.1.p20, which talks about lunatics moving inside the Moon. Not relevant. The next ones involve Professor Zvezdochkin discussing a book by Znayka. There's a mention of a river in the context of the Moon's interior, but that's not Ogurcovna. \\n\\nWait, the user mentioned Ogurcovna River. Let me check each paragraph again. The 24:1.1.1.p21 mentions a book causing a lot of noise, but no river. The 25:1.1.1.p22 talks about an academic discussion. 26:1.1.1.p23 is about the meeting starting. 27:1.1.1.p24 is the professor opening the meeting. \\n\\nLooking at 28:1.1.1.p25, the professor discusses the lack of bricks and lunar inhabitants. 29:1.1.1.p26 is Znayka responding. 30:1.1.1.p27 is the professor's rebuttal. 31:1.1.1.p28 is Znayka's argument about flying in a rocket. 32:1.1.1.p29 is the professor's comment. 33:1.1.1.p30 is Znayka's explanation about the water in the bottle. 34:1.1.1.p31 is the professor's reaction. \\n\\nWait, none of these paragraphs mention Ponchik, a dark night, or the Ogurcovna River. The user's snapshot has a recent evidence pointer 6:1.1.1.p3, which isn't in the current batch. The current batch items don't have any mention of Ponchik or the Ogurcovna River. Therefore, there's no evidence in the current batch that matches the task. So the decision should be 'not_found'.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2220,\"completion_tokens\":514,\"total_tokens\":2734}}\n",
