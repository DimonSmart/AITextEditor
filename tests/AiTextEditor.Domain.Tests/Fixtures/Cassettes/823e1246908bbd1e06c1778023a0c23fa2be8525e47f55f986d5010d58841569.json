The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided the first batch of items. Let me look through the items.\\n\\nThe first item in the batch has the pointer \\\"9:1.1.1.p6\\\" and the markdown content talks about Znayka returning to the Flower City and his stories. It mentions astronomer Steklyashkin observing the Moon and discussing lunar craters. However, there's no mention of Professor Zvezdokhin here. The text discusses lunar features and Steklyashkin's observations but doesn't reference the professor. \\n\\nSince the task is to find the first occurrence of Professor Zvezdokhin, and this batch doesn't have any mention of him, the evidence count remains zero. The decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there might be subsequent batches with the information. The user also indicated that there are more batches coming (hasMore: true), so we need to keep scanning. Therefore, the correct JSON response is to set decision as \\\"continue\\\" and newEvidence as an empty array since no matches were found in this batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":763,\"completion_tokens\":256,\"total_tokens\":1019}}\n",
