The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that dialogues are indicated by markers like quotes or dashes. The user provided a batch of items, and I need to scan through them.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look at each item's markdown content. The first item (27:1.1.1.p24) is a paragraph starting with a dash, but it's a single sentence without any dialogue between characters. The second item (28:1.1.1.p25) has a paragraph where Professor Zvezdochkin is giving a lecture. There's a part where he says, \\\"Ну, а раз кирпичей на самом-то деле не было...\\\" but this is a monologue, not a dialogue between two characters. The third item (29:1.1.1.p26) starts with \\\"Выслушав всё это, Знайка поднялся со своего места и сказал насмешливо:\\\" which is Znayka speaking, but there's no mention of another character responding here. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The second paragraph has Professor Zvezdochkin talking, but no other character is mentioned in dialogue. The third paragraph is Znayka speaking, but again, no interaction with another named character. The first paragraph has a dash, but it's a single line without dialogue. So, none of the items in this batch have a dialogue between two named characters. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there's no evidence here. But wait, the user said to output exactly one JSON object. Since there's no evidence, the newEvidence array should be empty, and the decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1051,\"completion_tokens\":386,\"total_tokens\":1437}}\n",
