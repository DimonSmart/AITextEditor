Let me see what steps I need to take.\\n\\nFirst, I remember that the user tried using the QueryCursor and MapCursor functions earlier, but they resulted in errors. Then, they switched to the whole book cursor and got the first portion of the book. The response includes some headings, but none mention Zvezdokhin. \\n\\nSince the initial portions didn\u0027t find the mention, I need to continue reading through the book. The GetNextPortion function was used, and the response showed the first few headings. But the user needs to keep going through the sections. \\n\\nMaybe the professor is mentioned in a later section. I should instruct the user to continue using GetNextPortion to retrieve subsequent portions until the mention is found. Alternatively, using the MapCursor function with an instruction to search for \u0027\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027 in each portion might be more efficient. However, since the previous MapCursor call also failed, perhaps there\u0027s an issue with the function, and manually checking each portion is necessary.\\n\\nWait, the user might not be able to proceed further due to the function errors. Alternatively, maybe the cursor is still active, and the next portion will include the relevant text. I should guide the user to keep fetching portions one by one until they find the mention. If the professor is mentioned in a specific chapter or section, the pointer from the portions will indicate the location. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the user can\u0027t proceed further, they might need to check if the book\u0027s content is properly loaded or if there\u0027s a different approach. But given the tools available, the best step is to continue retrieving portions and check each for the mention.\\n\u0022,\u0022tool_calls\u0022:[{\u0022id\u0022:\u0022call_xu2mmy97\u0022,\u0022index\u0022:0,\u0022type\u0022:\u0022function\u0022,\u0022function\u0022:{\u0022name\u0022:\u0022NavigationPlugin-GetNextPortion\u0022,\u0022arguments\u0022:\u0022{\\\u0022cursorName\\\u0022:\\\u0022CUR_WHOLE_BOOK_FORWARD\\\u0022}\u0022}}]},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022tool_calls\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:2316,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:391,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:2707}}\n",
