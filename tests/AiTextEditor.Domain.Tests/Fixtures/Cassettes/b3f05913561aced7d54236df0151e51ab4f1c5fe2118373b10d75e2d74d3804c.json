The goal is to find the first mention of 'визуализация лунного кратера' described as 'огромного круглого поля с земляным валом по краю'. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The user mentioned that the context requires the term 'визуализация лунного кратера' and the description 'огромного круглого поля с земляным валом по краю'. \\n\\nLooking at the items, the first paragraph (pointer 8:1.1.1.p5) talks about a lunar crater but doesn't mention the visualization term. The second paragraph (9:1.1.1.p6) has the description of a circular field with an earth embankment, which matches the required description. However, I need to check if it includes the exact term 'визуализация лунного кратера'. \\n\\nWait, the second paragraph's markdown mentions \\\"вообразите себе огромное круглое поле...\\\" which translates to \\\"imagine a huge circular field...\\\" but doesn't use the exact term. The term 'визуализация' (visualization) isn't present here. The third paragraph (10:1.1.1.p7) discusses theories about craters' origins but doesn't have the required terms. The fourth paragraph (11:1.1.1.p8) also doesn't mention the term or the description.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The second paragraph's description is \\\"огромное круглое поле, окружено земляным валом\\\", which matches the description part. But the term 'визуализация лунного кратера' isn't present in any of the items. The task requires both the term and the description. Since none of the items have the exact term, but the description is present in the second paragraph, maybe there's a mistake. However, the user's context says the term is present. Wait, perhaps the term is in the second paragraph? Let me check again. No, the term 'визуализация лунного кратера' isn't there. The closest is the description. Maybe the task's context is incorrect, but according to the input, the user provided the batch. Since the term isn't found, but the description is in the second paragraph, but the task requires both. Therefore, there's no match. But the user's context says the term is present. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each item again. \\n\\nWait, the second paragraph's markdown says: \\\"Чтобы понять, как выглядит такой лунный цирк, или кратер, вообразите себе огромное круглое поле...\\\" which translates to \\\"To understand how such a lunar cirque or crater looks, imagine a huge circular field...\\\" So the description is there, but the term 'визуализация лунного кратера' isn't present. Therefore, there's no match. But the task's context says the term is present. Maybe there's a typo or mistake in the input. Since the user's input might have an error, but according to the given data, there's no match. However, the user's task says to find the first mention, so if the term isn't present, the answer would be 'not_found'. But the user's context says the term is present. Wait, maybe the term is in the first paragraph? Let me check again. The first paragraph mentions \\\"лунных кратеров\\\" but not the exact term. So, perhaps the answer is 'not_found' because the term isn't present. But the user's context says it is. This is confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in the input. Given the data, I have to go with what's provided. Since the term isn't found, the answer is 'not_found'.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1875,\"completion_tokens\":849,\"total_tokens\":2724}}\n",
