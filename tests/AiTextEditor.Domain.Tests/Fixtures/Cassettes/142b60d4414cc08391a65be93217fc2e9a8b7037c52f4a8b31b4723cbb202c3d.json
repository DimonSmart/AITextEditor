The user is asking for the second occurrence, so I need to make sure I count each mention properly.\\n\\nFirst, I created a cursor named \\\"search_cursor\\\" with a filter to find any text containing \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" and not a header. But the initial agent run failed with an error. Maybe the filter was too specific or there was an issue with the cursor setup. \\n\\nThen I tried creating the cursor again without excluding headers, just looking for the term. The response was \\\"search_cursor\\\", which might mean the cursor was created successfully. Now, I need to run the agent again using this cursor to scan through the document portions. Since the agent can only process one batch at a time, I'll have to keep calling run_agent until I find all mentions. \\n\\nI should start by running the agent with the cursor to get the first set of results. If there are multiple mentions, the agent will return them, and I can check the order to find the second one. If the status says there are more items available, I'll need to continue scanning. It's important to make sure each mention is counted correctly, even if they're in the same paragraph. Also, I should check previous evidence in case the answer was found in an earlier batch. Let's proceed step by step.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_uj5zd0fk\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find all mentions of 'профессора Звёздочкина' (excluding headers)\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1160,\"completion_tokens\":343,\"total_tokens\":1503}}\n",
