The goal is to find the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The context is paragraphs with dialogue markers mentioning Znayka and Professor. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence, with the pointer \\\"30:1.1.1.p27\\\". But since the current batch items start from pointer 39, I should focus on those.\\n\\nLooking at the first item in the batch: pointer 39:1.1.1.p36. The markdown here is a paragraph where someone is talking about the Moon cooling from the surface. There's no mention of Znayka or a sarcastic comment here. \\n\\nNext, pointer 40:1.1.1.p37. This is a dialogue where someone from the audience shouts. Again, no Znayka here. \\n\\nThen pointer 41:1.3.1.p38. Here, Znayka is mentioned. The excerpt is: “– Верно! – подхватил Знайка. – Ещё не остывшее расплавленное вещество, то есть, попросту говоря, жидкость.” Translating that, Znayka agrees with the previous statement about the Moon's interior being liquid. But the task is about Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. \\n\\nWait, the original task mentions the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. However, in the current batch, the dialogue is about the Moon's cooling process. There's no mention of the professor here. The previous evidence pointer 30:1.1.1.p27 might have been from an earlier batch, but since the current batch doesn't include any mention of the professor or a sarcastic comment by Znayka regarding that specific point, there's no new evidence here. \\n\\nSo, the answer should be \\\"not_found\\\" because none of the current batch items meet the criteria. The existing evidence from the snapshot isn't in the current batch, and the current items don't have the required content.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":880,\"completion_tokens\":484,\"total_tokens\":1364}}\n",
