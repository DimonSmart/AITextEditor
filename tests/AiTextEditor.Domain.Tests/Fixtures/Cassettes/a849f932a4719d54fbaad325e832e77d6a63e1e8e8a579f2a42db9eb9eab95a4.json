The user wants me to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan each item's markdown content carefully. \\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer 36:1.1.1.p33, the markdown doesn't have \\\"Фуксии\\\". The second item, 37:1.1.1.p34, also doesn't mention it. The third item, 38:1.1.1.p35,同样 no mention. \\n\\nWait, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch's items don't have any references to Фуксии. So, there are no new evidence points here. \\n\\nSince the task requires finding all mentions and the current batch has none, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the user mentioned to not include pointers from the snapshot's recent list. So, the newEvidence array remains empty. \\n\\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden mentions. But after checking each paragraph thoroughly, there's nothing. Therefore, the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":845,\"completion_tokens\":275,\"total_tokens\":1120}}\n",
