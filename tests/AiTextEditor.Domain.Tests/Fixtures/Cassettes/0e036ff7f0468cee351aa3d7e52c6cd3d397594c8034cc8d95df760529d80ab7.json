The task is to find the first mention of Fuchs in the text. The user provided a batch of items, and I need to scan through them to find any evidence related to Fuchs. \\n\\nFirst, I'll go through each item in the batch. The snapshot shows that there's no previous evidence, so I don't have to exclude any pointers. The items are a mix of headings and paragraphs. The headings don't seem relevant, so I'll focus on the paragraphs.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (pointer 4:1.1.1.p1), the text talks about Nезнайка's trip to the Sun City and the changes in the Flower City. No mention of Fuchs here. The next paragraph (5:1.1.1.p2) mentions the construction projects and a clothing factory by engineer Клёпки. Still no Fuchs. \\n\\nThe third paragraph (6:1.1.1.p3) discusses Ponчик's problem with clothes, but again, no Fuchs. The fourth paragraph (7:1.1.1.p4) continues the story about Ponчик and the moth problem. Still nothing. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. All the paragraphs are about the Flower City's developments, the clothing factory, and Ponчик's issues. There's no mention of Fuchs in any of these. The headings also don't reference Fuchs. \\n\\nSince there's no evidence in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The newEvidence array will be empty. I need to make sure not to include any pointers from the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers, but since the snapshot is empty, that's not an issue here. \\n\\nSo the final output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence entries.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1877,\"completion_tokens\":389,\"total_tokens\":2266}}\n",
