Let me start by creating a cursor to search for mentions of him. I'll use the mcp-create_cursor function with the description \\\"Mentions of Professor Zvezdokhin (excluding headers)\\\" and name it \\\"search_cursor\\\". \\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, I need to run the agent to find the first mention. So I'll call mcp-run_agent with the cursor name \\\"search_cursor\\\" and task description \\\"Find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin\\\". \\n\\nAfter getting the first result, I should check if there's a second mention. If the first paragraph has two mentions, I need to note that. If not, continue iterating by running the agent again with the same cursor. Each time, I'll check the response to see if there's a next pointer. If the cursor is complete or no more mentions are found, I'll stop. \\n\\nI have to make sure not to include any headers in the search. The user wants the actual text paragraphs where the mentions are. If the second mention isn't found after iterating, I should inform the user it's not present. Also, I need to track the pointers and include the semantic pointer in the answer once found.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_r7w5lubj\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":803,\"completion_tokens\":312,\"total_tokens\":1115}}\n",
