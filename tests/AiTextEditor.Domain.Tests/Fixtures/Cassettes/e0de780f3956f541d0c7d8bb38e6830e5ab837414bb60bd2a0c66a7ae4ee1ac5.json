The user wants the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin and then rewrite the paragraph adding that the apple trees started to bloom at that moment.\\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to find the first occurrence. The previous assistant used cursor-create_cursor with filterDescription containing 'профессора Звёздочкина' and maxEvidenceCount set to 1. The response was a search_cursor. Now, I need to run the agent to get the evidence.\\n\\nWait, the user's last message was the tool response, so I should call agent-run_agent with the cursor name and task description. The task is to find the first mention. Then, once I have the paragraph, I need to add the part about the apple trees blooming. But I have to make sure that the original paragraph is correctly retrieved first. Let me check if the cursor was created successfully. Since the tool response was \\\"search_cursor\\\", the next step is to run the agent on that cursor. The maxEvidenceCount is already 1, so it should return the first occurrence. Then, I can take that paragraph, add the sentence about the apple trees, and present it. But I need to ensure that the original text is correctly captured and the addition is properly integrated. Also, I should check if the apple trees part is mentioned elsewhere, but the user specifically wants it added in this context. Alright, let's proceed step by step.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_40uubppf\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of профессора Звёздочкина\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1142,\"completion_tokens\":356,\"total_tokens\":1498}}\n",
