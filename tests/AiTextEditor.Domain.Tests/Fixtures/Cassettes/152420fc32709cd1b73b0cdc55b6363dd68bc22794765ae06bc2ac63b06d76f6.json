The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions lines with dialogue markers or character names. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items. The first item (pointer 24:1.1.1.p21) has a paragraph where Professor Zvezdochkin is mentioned, but there's no dialogue here. The second item (25:1.1.1.p22) mentions the professor proposing a discussion, but again, no direct dialogue. The third item (26:1.1.1.p23) starts with the professor entering and his first words. Wait, the paragraph says \\\"первое, что от него услышали, были слова:\\\" which translates to \\\"The first thing they heard from him were words:\\\" but there's no actual dialogue quoted here. \\n\\nHmm, maybe the dialogue starts in the next paragraph? But the batch only includes up to p23. Wait, the user's input shows that the firstBatch is false, and hasMoreBatches is true, but the current batch only has these three items. So maybe the first dialogue is in the next batch, but since we can only scan the current batch, perhaps there's no dialogue here. Alternatively, maybe the professor's words in p23 are considered dialogue. But the excerpt doesn't have the actual dialogue text, just the setup. \\n\\nWait, the task says to look for dialogues with markers or character names. The first mention of a dialogue might be in the next batch. But since we can't look ahead, and the current batch doesn't have any actual dialogue lines, maybe there's no evidence here. But the user's snapshot has evidenceCount 0, so if there's no dialogue in the current batch, the decision would be 'not_found'. However, maybe the professor's words in p23 are considered the start of the dialogue. But the excerpt doesn't include the actual dialogue content. \\n\\nWait, the paragraph in p23 says \\\"первое, что от него услышали, были слова:\\\" which is the setup, but the actual dialogue isn't present here. So there's no dialogue in the current batch. Therefore, the answer would be 'not_found' because there's no dialogue between two named characters in the provided items. But wait, maybe the professor's words in p23 are the first dialogue. But the excerpt doesn't have the actual dialogue text. So the answer is 'not_found'.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1131,\"completion_tokens\":544,\"total_tokens\":1675}}\n",
