The user is looking for a description of two rotating buildings on Kolokolchikov Street with a spiral descent and a devil's wheel on the roof. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence found, pointed to as \\\"4:1.1.1.p1\\\". But the current batch doesn't have any items with that pointer. The items here are from pointers 36 to 57, all related to a discussion about the Moon's interior structure, like the liquid inside cooling and forming a hollow space. None of these paragraphs mention anything about buildings, rotation, spiral descents, or a devil's wheel. The context is entirely about lunar geology, not architecture or street features. Since the task requires specific elements not present in the current batch, there's no relevant evidence to extract. So the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required information isn't present here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2384,\"completion_tokens\":206,\"total_tokens\":2590}}\n",
