The user wants the first mention of Znayka comparing the lunar surface to pancake and steam bubbles. The context is paragraphs mentioning 'Знайка' and comparing the lunar surface to pancake or steam bubbles. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows that there are already 2 pieces of evidence, but the user is asking for the first mention. Wait, the task says \\\"find the first mention,\\\" but the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include items from previous batches. However, the current batch's items start from pointer 21:1.1.1.p18 onwards.\\n\\nLooking at the first item in the batch (pointer 21:1.1.1.p18), the markdown mentions Znayka rejecting his pancake theory after visiting the Moon and seeing a crater. The excerpt says \\\"кольцевая гора была совсем не гора, а остатки разрушившейся от времени гигантской кирпичной стены.\\\" Wait, that's about a brick wall, not pancake or steam bubbles. So maybe this isn't the right one.\\n\\nNext, pointer 22:1.1.1.p19 talks about Znayka realizing the walls were made by intelligent beings. The markdown mentions \\\"толстыми кирпичными стенами\\\" again, but no pancake or steam bubbles here. \\n\\nThen pointer 23:1.1.1.p20 discusses the lunar inhabitants moving inside the Moon. No mention of pancake or steam bubbles here either. \\n\\nWait, the task is to find the first mention where Znayka compares the lunar surface to pancake or steam bubbles. The initial snapshot's recentEvidencePointers are from previous batches, but the current batch's items don't have any mention of pancake or steam bubbles. The first item mentions a pancake theory, but the comparison is about the crater being a brick wall, not the surface. The user's task is to find the first mention of Znayka comparing the lunar surface to pancake and steam bubbles. Since none of the current batch items mention that specific comparison, maybe there's no new evidence here. \\n\\nBut the user's task says \\\"Find the first mention,\\\" and the snapshot's evidenceCount is 2. However, the current batch's items don't have any matches for the required comparison. Therefore, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no new evidence in the current batch that meets the criteria. The existing evidence from previous batches might have the first mention, but the current batch doesn't add any new ones. So the answer should be \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1326,\"completion_tokens\":582,\"total_tokens\":1908}}\n",
