The user wants to find the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the provided batch items. First, I need to scan through each item's markdown content to see if \\\"Пончик\\\" appears.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer \\\"10:1.1.1.p7\\\", the markdown talks about lunar craters and astronomers arguing about their origins. There's no mention of Пончик here. The second item has pointer \\\"11:1.1.1.p8\\\". The markdown here describes Znayka's theory about lunar craters comparing them to pancakes. Wait, the user is looking for Пончик, which is a character from a Russian story, maybe \\\"Ponchik\\\" the pastry. Let me check the text again. \\n\\nIn the second paragraph, the text mentions \\\"пекутся блины\\\" (pancakes are being cooked) and describes the process of making pancakes. But I don't see the word \\\"Пончик\\\" here. The user's task is to find the first mention of Пончик. Since the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", which isn't in the current batch, maybe the current batch doesn't have any new evidence. Wait, the user's input includes a snapshot with evidenceCount 1, but the current batch's items don't have Пончик. So, there's no new evidence here. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the current batch doesn't contain the required mention. I need to make sure not to include any pointers from the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers. Since none of the current items have Пончик, the output should indicate that no new evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1098,\"completion_tokens\":381,\"total_tokens\":1479}}\n",
