Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to use the tools provided. The user mentioned using the keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor function for specific keyword searches. Since the question is about the first mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин,\\\" I should use that as the keyword. But wait, the function requires lowercase word stems to cover inflected forms. So maybe I should use \\\"профессор звёздочкин\\\" in lowercase as the keyword. However, the name might be in Cyrillic, so I need to make sure the tool can handle that. \\n\\nWait, the function's description says to provide lowercase word stems. But the name \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" is a proper noun, so maybe it's better to use the exact form. However, the tool might not handle Cyrillic characters properly. Alternatively, maybe the book uses the name in a specific form, so I should check for that. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a character in a Russian book, perhaps \\\"The Master and Margarita\\\" by Bulgakov, where Professor Zvezdochkin is a character. If that's the case, the first mention might be in a specific chapter. But I shouldn't assume the book's content. \\n\\nThe user wants the first mention, so I need to search for the keyword \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" and find the earliest occurrence. Using the keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor function with the keywords array containing \\\"профессор звёздочкин\\\" (lowercase) might help. Then, using the read_cursor_batch function to get the results. \\n\\nWait, but the function requires lowercase word stems. So maybe I should use \\\"профессор звёздочкин\\\" as the keyword, but in lowercase. However, Cyrillic characters might not be handled as lowercase. Alternatively, maybe the tool can process Cyrillic. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo, and the correct name is \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" without the \\\"профессор\\\" part. But the question specifically mentions \\\"профессор Звёздочкин,\\\" so I should include that. \\n\\nSo, the plan is: create a keyword cursor with the keywords \\\"профессор звёздочкин\\\" (lowercase), then read the cursor batch to find the first occurrence. Then, check the pointers to see where it is in the document. \\n\\nBut I need to make sure that the cursor is created correctly. The function parameters require an array of keywords. So the arguments would be {\\\"keywords\\\": [\\\"профессор звёздочкин\\\"]}. Then, after creating the cursor, read the batch to get the matching paragraphs. \\n\\nOnce I have the results, I can check the pointers to find the earliest mention. If there are multiple mentions, the first one in the document order would be the answer. \\n\\nI should also check if there's any previous evidence, but since this is the first query, there's none. So proceed with creating the keyword cursor.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_p81gpe61\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"профессор звёздочкин\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":893,\"completion_tokens\":688,\"total_tokens\":1581}}\n",
