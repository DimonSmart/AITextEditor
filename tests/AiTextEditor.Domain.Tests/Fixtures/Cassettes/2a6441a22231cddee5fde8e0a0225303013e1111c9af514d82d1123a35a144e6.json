Now, I should run the agent on that cursor to get the first occurrence.\\n\\nWait, the tools available include mcp-run_agent, which takes the cursor name and a task description. The task here is to find the first mention. So I'll call mcp-run_agent with cursorName \\\"search_cursor\\\" and taskDescription \\\"Find the first mention of профессор Звёздочкин\\\".\\n\\nAfter running the agent, the response will give the evidence items. The first paragraph that mentions him is the answer. I need to check the pointerLabel and the text to make sure it's not a header.
