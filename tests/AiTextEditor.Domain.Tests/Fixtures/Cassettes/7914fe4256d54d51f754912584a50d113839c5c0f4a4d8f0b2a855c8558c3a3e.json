The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with exactly two character names followed by dialogue markers. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items. The first item (24:1.1.1.p21) is a paragraph discussing Professor Zvezdochkin's reaction to Znayka's book. There's no dialogue here, just narration. The second item (25:1.1.1.p22) mentions the professor proposing a discussion and Znayka attending. Still no dialogue. The third item (26:1.1.1.p23) starts with the professor entering and his first words. Wait, the paragraph says \\\"первое, что от него услышали, были слова:\\\" which translates to \\\"The first thing they heard from him were words:\\\" but there's no actual dialogue here yet. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The task says lines with exactly two character names followed by dialogue markers. So the dialogue should have two names and then the dialogue. In the first paragraph, there's a mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" and \\\"Знайка\\\" but they are not in a dialogue line. The second paragraph mentions \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" and \\\"Знайка\\\" again, but the dialogue hasn't started yet. The third paragraph starts with the professor's words but doesn't have a dialogue line yet. \\n\\nWait, maybe the first dialogue is in the second paragraph. Let me check again. The second paragraph says \\\"Знайка приехал, и обсуждение состоялось. Оно началось, как и полагается в таких случаях, с доклада, который вызвался сделать сам профессор Звёздочкин.\\\" There's no dialogue here. The third paragraph starts with the professor entering and his words, but again, no dialogue line. \\n\\nHmm, maybe there's no dialogue in the provided batch. The user might have intended that the first dialogue is between Zvezdochkin and Znayka. But according to the given text, the first dialogue might not be present. Wait, looking at the first paragraph again: \\\"А действительный член академии астрономических наук профессор Звёздочкин, которому тоже случилось прочитать Знайкину книжку, просто кипел от негодования и говорил, что книга эта – вовсе не книга, а какая-то, как он выразился, чёртова чепуха.\\\" Here, the professor is speaking, but it's not a dialogue line with two names. \\n\\nWait, maybe the first dialogue is in the second paragraph. Let me check again. The second paragraph mentions \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" and \\\"Знайка\\\" but no dialogue. The third paragraph starts with the professor's words but no dialogue. So perhaps there's no dialogue in the current batch. But the user's task says to find the first dialog between two named characters. Since the provided batch doesn't have any dialogue lines with two names, maybe the answer is \\\"not_found\\\". But the user might have intended that the first dialogue is between Zvezdochkin and Znayka. However, based on the given text, there's no such dialogue. Therefore, the correct decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1134,\"completion_tokens\":761,\"total_tokens\":1895}}\n",
