The user asked to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin and rewrite the paragraph, adding that the apple trees started to blossom at that moment.\\n\\nFirst, I needed to create a cursor to find the first occurrence. I used cursor-create_cursor with the filter for 'профессора Звёздочкина' and maxEvidenceCount 1. The response gave the pointer 3:1.1.1, which is a heading. But the user wanted the actual paragraph, not just the heading. So I created another cursor, content_cursor, starting after that pointer to get the following content. \\n\\nWait, the initial cursor found the heading, but the actual paragraph might be in the next section. The agent-run_agent was used to get the first mention, which was the heading. Then, to get the paragraph, I needed to create a new cursor starting after that pointer. However, the response from the content_cursor might not have included the paragraph. Maybe the paragraph is part of the same section. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the heading is part of the same paragraph. But the user specified to add the apple blossoming detail to the paragraph. Since the initial search found the heading, but the actual content might be in the next paragraph. However, the tool response for the content_cursor might not have provided the necessary text. \\n\\nWait, the user's final answer included the heading as the target, but the instruction was to rewrite the paragraph. Maybe the heading is the only mention, and there's no subsequent paragraph. In that case, the answer combined the heading with the added information about the apple trees. The assistant then used editor-create_targets to link the pointer to the modified text. \\n\\nSo the final answer is the heading with the added sentence about the apple trees blossoming. The user might have intended that even if the original text didn't have a full paragraph, the heading was considered the mention, and the addition was made there. Therefore, the response correctly includes the heading with the new information.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1736,\"completion_tokens\":498,\"total_tokens\":2234}}\n",
