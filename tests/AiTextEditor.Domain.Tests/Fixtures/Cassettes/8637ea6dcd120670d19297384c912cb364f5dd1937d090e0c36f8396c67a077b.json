The task is to check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different. Then return the names and the dialogue text.\\n\\nFirst, I need to look at the current batch items. The batch has three items: pointers 15:1.1.1.p12, 16:1.1.1.p13, and 17:1.1.1.p14. All are Paragraph type.\\n\\nLet me check each one's markdown.\\n\\nFirst item: \\\"– Для чего понадобилась ещё эта блинистая теория, если и без того ясно, что лунные кратеры – это просто вулканы?\\\" Starts with a dash, not a character name followed by colon. So probably not a name.\\n\\nSecond item: \\\"Знайка отвечал, что вулкан – это очень большая гора, на верхушке которой имеется сравнительно небольшой кратер, то есть отверстие. Если бы хоть один лунный кратер был кратером вулкана, то сам вулкан был бы величиной чуть ли не во всю Луну, а этого вовсе не наблюдается.\\\" This starts with \\\"Знайка отвечал, что...\\\" So \\\"Знайка\\\" is a name, but followed by \\\"отвечал, что\\\" which is like \\\"answered that\\\". But the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So maybe a colon after the name? Like \\\"Знайка: ...\\\" but here it's \\\"Знайка отвечал, что...\\\" which is not a colon. So maybe not matching the pattern.\\n\\nThird item: \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" Starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which is \\\"Meteorites said:\\\" but \\\"Метеоритчики\\\" is plural. The task says \\\"each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" has \\\"говорили:\\\" which is \\\"said:\\\" but the name part is \\\"Метеоритчики\\\" which is a group name. But the task says \\\"character's name\\\", so maybe plural names count? But the key is whether it's followed by a colon. Here, \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" – the colon is after \\\"говорили\\\", so the structure is \\\"Name + verb + colon\\\"? Wait, \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" translates to \\\"Meteorites said:\\\" but in Russian, \\\"говорили\\\" is the verb, so the structure is \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which is \\\"Meteorites said:\\\" followed by a colon. But the actual dialogue would come after the colon. However, in this item, the markdown is just \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" with nothing after. So maybe the next paragraph would have the dialogue, but this is the current batch.\\n\\nWait, the task is about consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon. So for example, if one paragraph starts with \\\"Alice: Hello\\\" and the next starts with \\\"Bob: Hi\\\", then those two are consecutive and different names.\\n\\nBut looking at the current batch:\\n\\nFirst paragraph starts with a dash, not a name followed by colon.\\n\\nSecond paragraph starts with \\\"Знайка отвечал, что...\\\" which is \\\"Znayka answered that...\\\" – so the name is \\\"Знайка\\\", but followed by \\\"отвечал, что\\\" (answered that), not a colon. So maybe not matching the pattern.\\n\\nThird paragraph starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which is \\\"Meteorites said:\\\" – here, \\\"говорили\\\" is the verb, and then a colon. So the structure is \\\"Name + verb + colon\\\". But the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So maybe \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" is considered as starting with the name followed by a verb and colon. But the exact pattern might require the name followed directly by a colon. For example, \\\"Знайка: ...\\\" or \\\"Метеоритчики: ...\\\". But in this case, it's \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which is \\\"Meteorites said:\\\" so the colon is after the verb. So maybe not exactly a colon right after the name.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe \\\"говорили:\\\" is part of the structure. But the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So perhaps \\\"similar\\\" includes things like \\\"said:\\\" or \\\"asked:\\\" etc. But the name should be followed by the verb and then colon. But the exact requirement is a bit unclear.\\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So maybe the name followed by a colon, or maybe a verb like \\\"said\\\" followed by colon. But the key is whether the paragraph starts with the name and then a colon. For example, \\\"Alice: Hello\\\" or \\\"Alice said: Hello\\\". But in the third item, it's \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which is \\\"Meteorites said:\\\" – so the structure is \\\"Name + verb + colon\\\". So the colon is after the verb. So the name is followed by the verb and then colon. So maybe that's considered \\\"similar\\\" to a colon after the name.\\n\\nBut the second item starts with \\\"Знайка отвечал, что...\\\" which is \\\"Znayka answered that...\\\" – so again, name followed by verb and then comma. So not a colon right after the name.\\n\\nSo looking at the current batch:\\n\\n- First item: starts with dash, not a name.\\n\\n- Second item: starts with \\\"Знайка отвечал, что...\\\" – name followed by verb, no colon.\\n\\n- Third item: starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" – name followed by verb and colon.\\n\\nBut the task is looking for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar. So for example, if two consecutive paragraphs each start with a name followed by colon. But in this batch, the third item starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" but the second item doesn't start with a name followed by colon. The second item starts with \\\"Знайка отвечал, что...\\\" which is not a colon. So maybe there's no consecutive pairs here.\\n\\nWait, but maybe the third item is part of a pair. Let's see. The third item is \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" – but there's nothing after the colon in this item. So maybe the next paragraph (not in this batch) would have the dialogue. But the current batch only has these three items.\\n\\nSo in the current batch, do any of the paragraphs start with a character's name followed by a colon or similar?\\n\\nThird item: \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" – yes, starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which is a name followed by verb and colon. So maybe that's considered as matching.\\n\\nBut the second item starts with \\\"Знайка отвечал, что...\\\" which is name followed by verb and comma. So not a colon. So the second item doesn't have a colon after the name.\\n\\nFirst item starts with a dash, so no.\\n\\nSo in this batch, only the third item starts with a name followed by \\\"говорили:\\\" which is a verb and colon. But the task requires consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by colon. So for example, if two in a row. But here, only one item in the batch has that pattern. So maybe no consecutive pairs here.\\n\\nBut the task says \\\"consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different\\\". So each of the consecutive paragraphs must start with a name followed by colon/similar, and the names must be different.\\n\\nIn the current batch, the third item starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\", but the previous item (second) starts with \\\"Знайка отвечал, что...\\\" which is not a colon. So they are not consecutive in the required pattern. So maybe no evidence here.\\n\\nWait, but maybe the second item's \\\"Знайка отвечал, что...\\\" is considered as part of the pattern. But the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So \\\"similar\\\" might include things like \\\"said\\\", \\\"asked\\\", etc., followed by a colon. But in the second item, it's \\\"Знайка отвечал, что...\\\" which is \\\"Znayka answered that...\\\" – so the structure is name + verb + comma + ... So no colon. So maybe not matching.\\n\\nThird item: \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" – name + verb + colon. So that's a match for a single paragraph starting with name followed by verb and colon. But the task is about consecutive paragraphs where each starts with such a pattern. So if there's two in a row, each starting with name followed by colon/similar, and different names.\\n\\nBut in this batch, only the third item has that pattern. The second item doesn't have a colon after the name. So no consecutive pairs here.\\n\\nTherefore, there's no evidence in this batch that meets the criteria. So the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there's more batches, but no new evidence found here.\\n\\nWait, but the task says \\\"If a paragraph contains multiple mentions, report it once as evidence. The counting logic will handle the rest.\\\" But in this case, there's no evidence that matches the criteria. So newEvidence should be empty.\\n\\nBut the rules say: Do NOT add evidence for a pointer that appears in snapshot.recentEvidencePointers. But snapshot.recentEvidencePointers is empty, so that's not an issue.\\n\\nSo for the current batch, check each item:\\n\\n- pointer 15:1.1.1.p12: starts with dash, not a name followed by colon. So no.\\n\\n- pointer 16:1.1.1.p13: starts with \\\"Знайка отвечал, что...\\\" – no colon after name. So no.\\n\\n- pointer 17:1.1.1.p14: starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" – yes, but it's a single paragraph. But the task requires consecutive paragraphs where each starts with such a pattern. So even if this one matches, unless there's another one right after it (in the next batch), but in this batch, there's only one. So no consecutive pairs here.\\n\\nTherefore, no new evidence to report. So newEvidence is empty list.\\n\\nDecision: since maxEvidenceCount is null, and evidenceCount is 0, but we didn't find any new evidence. So decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there's more batches (hasMoreBatches is true).\\n\\nSo output JSON:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\",\\n  \\\"newEvidence\\\": []\\n}\\n\\nWait, but the rules say: \\\"If 'maxEvidenceCount' is provided in the task and you have found enough evidence (snapshot.evidenceCount + newEvidence.length \\u003e= maxEvidenceCount), set decision=\\\"done\\\".\\\"\\n\\nBut here, maxEvidenceCount is null, so that condition doesn't apply. So decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there's more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), and we didn't find any evidence.\\n\\nYes. So the output should have decision \\\"continue\\\" and newEvidence empty.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":818,\"completion_tokens\":2489,\"total_tokens\":3307}}\n",
