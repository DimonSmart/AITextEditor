The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions looking for direct speech markers like quotes or dashes. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so we need to find the first occurrence in the current batch.\\n\\nLooking at the first item's markdown: \\\"– Для чего понадобилась ещё эта блинистая теория...\\\" The dash here might indicate dialogue. But it's a single paragraph, maybe a character speaking, but not a dialogue between two. \\n\\nThe second item has \\\"Знайка отвечал...\\\" which is a character (Знайка) speaking, but again, it's a single voice. No interaction between two named characters yet.\\n\\nThe third item starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which is a group speaking. Still, it's not a dialogue between two named individuals. \\n\\nWait, maybe the first item's dash is part of a dialogue. But the problem is, the task requires two named characters. The current batch items don't have two named characters in dialogue. The first item might be a single character's speech, and the second is Знайка speaking. The third is a group. So there's no direct dialogue between two named characters here. \\n\\nTherefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since none of the current batch items meet the criteria. The evidenceCount is 0, and the newEvidence array would be empty. So the output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":798,\"completion_tokens\":330,\"total_tokens\":1128}}\n",
