The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that all paragraphs with dialogue markers like quotes or dashes should be considered. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items:\\n\\n1. The first item (27:1.1.1.p24) is a paragraph starting with a dash, which might indicate a dialogue marker. The content is a speaker addressing the audience, but there's no dialogue here. It's more of a开场白, so maybe not a dialogue between two characters.\\n\\n2. The second item (28:1.1.1.p25) has a paragraph where Professor Zvezdochkin starts speaking. There's a dialogue here, but it's the professor talking, not two characters. The professor is addressing the audience, so this might not be a dialogue between two named characters.\\n\\n3. The third item (29:1.1.1.p26) mentions Znayka standing up and speaking mockingly. Again, this is a single character speaking, not a dialogue between two.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. The first item has a dash, which could be a dialogue marker. The paragraph starts with \\\"– Дорогие друзья, разрешите заседание...\\\" which seems like a speaker addressing the audience, not a dialogue between two people. The professor's paragraph (item 28) is a monologue. The third item is Znayka speaking. \\n\\nHmm, maybe there's no dialogue between two named characters in the current batch. The task says to use only the current batch, and the snapshot has zero evidence. Since the user is asking for the first dialogue between two named characters, but in the provided items, there's only one character speaking each time. So perhaps there's no evidence here. But the user might expect that the first item's dash is considered a dialogue marker. However, the content doesn't show two characters. \\n\\nWait, maybe the first item is a dialogue between the speaker and the audience? But the audience isn't a named character. The professor is a named character, but he's speaking alone. Znayka is another named character, but he's speaking alone. So there's no dialogue between two named characters. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no evidence in the current batch that meets the criteria. But the user might have intended that the first item's dash is a dialogue marker. However, the content doesn't show two characters. So the correct answer is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1045,\"completion_tokens\":558,\"total_tokens\":1603}}\n",
