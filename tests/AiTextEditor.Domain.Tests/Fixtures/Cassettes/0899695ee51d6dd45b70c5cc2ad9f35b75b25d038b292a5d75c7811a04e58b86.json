The user wants to know the first occurrence and a brief description of his character. Let me start by creating a cursor to search for mentions of him. I'll use the cursor-create_cursor function with a filter that looks for \\\"Звёздочкин\\\". Then, I'll run the agent to find the first mention. Once I get the evidence, I'll check the paragraph for his character description. If it's in the first item, I'll note the pointer. If not, I'll continue searching. I need to make sure to stop after the first occurrence and include the pointer in the answer.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_1mmw2nfg\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"Contains 'Звёздочкин'\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"maxElements\\\":1000,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1082,\"completion_tokens\":204,\"total_tokens\":1286}}\n",
