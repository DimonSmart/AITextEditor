The task is to find the first dialog between two named characters and state their names. The user provided a batch of text items. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through each item's markdown content to find any dialogues. Dialogues are usually indicated by quotation marks or dialogue tags. Since the task mentions \\\"названными по имени персонажами,\\\" the characters should be named explicitly.\\n\\nLooking at the items:\\n\\n- The first few paragraphs (74-79) involve Звёздочкин and some коротышки, but the dialogues here are more commands rather than a conversation between two named characters. For example, the line \\\"– Вот когда полетишь на Луну...\\\" is a command from a коротышка to Звёздочкин, but it's not a dialogue between two named individuals.\\n\\n- The next items (84-86) mention Знайка in a caricature, but that's a description, not a dialogue. The text mentions Знайка being depicted in a comic, but there's no actual dialogue between two named characters here.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The user's snapshot has recent evidence pointers, but the current batch might not have the required dialogues. The task says \\\"первый диалог,\\\" so if there's no such dialogue in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found.\\\" However, the user's input shows that the batch ends here, and there's no mention of any dialogue between two named characters. \\n\\nThe only dialogues are between Звёздочкин and the коротышки, but the коротышки aren't named. The task requires two named characters. Since there's no dialogue between two named characters in the provided batch, the correct decision is \\\"not_found.\\\"\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1603,\"completion_tokens\":399,\"total_tokens\":2002}}\n",
