The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdochkin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided a batch of text which is a paragraph from what seems like a story or a book. The paragraph talks about the inhabitants of the Sun City helping the little people from the Flower City with construction, specifically mentioning Engineer Klyepka's project for a clothing factory. The paragraph mentions various items like rubber bras, synthetic fur coats, and machines doing the sewing. \\n\\nNow, the key here is to check if there's any mention of Professor Zvezdochkin in this batch. The user's context says to exclude headers, so I need to make sure that the paragraph isn't a header. The paragraph starts with \\\"И это ещё не всё, конечно.\\\" which translates to \\\"And that's not all, of course.\\\" So it's part of the main text.\\n\\nLooking through the paragraph, the names mentioned are Engineer Klyepka and some products. There's no mention of Professor Zvezdochkin here. The paragraph discusses the factory and its operations but doesn't reference any professor by that name. Since the task is to find the first occurrence, and this batch doesn't have it, the decision should be 'continue' because there might be more batches to check. The evidence count is zero, so the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, which aligns with not finding any evidence here. The user's snapshot also shows that the afterPointer is 5:1.1.1.p2, which is the pointer of the current item. Since the current batch doesn't have the mention, we need to continue scanning the next batches. Therefore, the correct JSON response would have decision 'continue' and an empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":735,\"completion_tokens\":379,\"total_tokens\":1114}}\n",
