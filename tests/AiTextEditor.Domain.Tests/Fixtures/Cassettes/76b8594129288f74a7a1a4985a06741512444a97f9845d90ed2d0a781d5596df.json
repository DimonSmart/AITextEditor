Все коротышки с увлечением читали её. Многие учёные хвалили эту книжку за то, что она интересно написана, но всё же высказывали недовольство тем, что она научно не обоснована. А действительный член академии астрономических наук профессор Звёздочкин, которому тоже случилось прочитать Знайкину книжку, просто кипел от негодования и говорил, что книга эта – вовсе не книга, а какая-то, как он выразился, чёртова чепуха. Этот профессор Звёздочкин был не то чтобы какой-нибудь очень сердитый субъект. Нет, он был довольно добрый коротышка, но очень, как бы это сказать, требовательный, непримиримый. Во всяком деле он ценил больше всего точность, порядок и терпеть не мог никаких фантазий, то есть выдумок.\\\",\\\"reason\\\":\\\"Упоминание профессора Звёздочкина в контексте его реакции на книгу Знайкина.\\\"}]}\",\"reasoning\":\"Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants the first non-header mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" in the provided batch. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence with pointer \\\"3:1.1.1\\\", but since the current batch's items start from 24:1.1.1.p21, I need to check these new items.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look through each item's markdown content. The first item (24:1.1.1.p21) has a paragraph where \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" is mentioned. The excerpt here is the entire paragraph, but the key part is where he reacts to the book. Since this is the first occurrence in the current batch and it's a paragraph, this should be the evidence. The reason is that it directly mentions the professor in a non-header context. The other items (25 and 26) also mention him, but since the task is for the first occurrence, only the first one in the batch needs to be included. Also, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"3:1.1.1\\\", which isn't in the current batch, so no conflict here. The decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because the maxEvidenceCount is 1, and we've found one. But wait, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 1, and the newEvidence here is adding another. However, the task's maxEvidenceCount is 1, so if adding this new one would make the total 2, but the user might have already counted the previous. Wait, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 1, and the task's max is 1. So maybe the user is looking for the first occurrence in the entire context, not just the current batch. But the instructions say to use only the current batch. So in the current batch, the first mention is in 24:1.1.1.p21. So the newEvidence should include that. The decision would be \\\"done\\\" because maxEvidenceCount is 1 and we found one. But the snapshot's evidenceCount is 1, so adding this new one would make it 2, but the task's max is 1. Wait, maybe the snapshot's evidenceCount is from previous batches, and the current batch's newEvidence is added on top. But the task's maxEvidenceCount is 1, so if the total (snapshot.evidenceCount + newEvidence.length) reaches or exceeds 1, then decision is done. Since snapshot.evidenceCount is 1, and adding 1 new would make 2, which is over 1. But the task's max is 1, so maybe the user wants only one. Wait, the task says \\\"Find the first non-header mention\\\", so maybe the first occurrence in the entire context, but the rules say to use only current batch. So in the current batch, the first mention is in 24:1.1.1.p21. So the newEvidence should include that. The decision would be \\\"done\\\" because maxEvidenceCount is 1 and we found one. But the snapshot's evidenceCount is 1, so adding this new one would make it 2, but the task's max is 1. Wait, maybe the snapshot's evidenceCount is the count from previous batches, and the current batch's newEvidence is added. So if the task's max is 1, and the snapshot's evidenceCount is 1, then adding even one more would exceed. But the user might have already found one in previous batches, and now the current batch's first mention is the second. But the task says \\\"Find the first non-header mention\\\", so maybe the first occurrence overall. However, the rules state to use only the current batch. So in the current batch, the first mention is in 24:1.1.1.p21. Therefore, the newEvidence should include that, and since the max is 1, the decision is \\\"done\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1142,\"completion_tokens\":1166,\"total_tokens\":2308}}\n",
