The user is asking where Professor Zvezdokhinn is first mentioned and described in terms of his character. The previous steps used a cursor to find mentions of 'Звёздочкин' and ran the agent to get the first occurrence.\\n\\nThe tool response shows that the first mention is at Pointer 3:1.1.1 with the heading \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". The excerpt is a heading, but the user wants the first paragraph that describes him, not just the heading. The heading might be part of a section that includes the description. Since the agent's first result is the heading, but the actual description might be in the following paragraphs. However, the user's question specifies to return the first paragraph that mentions him, not the heading. The assistant needs to check if the heading is considered part of the text or just metadata. Since the user mentioned to treat headings as metadata, the actual description might be in the next paragraphs. But the tool's response only provided the heading as the first evidence. The user might need to look further, but the assistant should check if the heading's content includes the description. The heading says \\\"How Znayka defeated Professor Zvezdokhinn,\\\" which might imply his character as someone who was defeated, but the user wants a character description. The assistant should confirm if the heading is sufficient or if more info is needed. Since the tool's response only gave the heading, and the user wants the first mention in the text, the assistant should check if the heading is considered part of the text. If not, then the next step would be to create another cursor starting after that pointer to find the first paragraph describing him. But according to the previous instructions, the assistant should stop when the relevant paragraph is found. Since the first evidence is the heading, but the user wants the first paragraph, maybe the answer is in the same section. However, the tool's response doesn't provide the paragraph text. The assistant might need to use the editor-read_document function to get the full text around that pointer. Alternatively, since the user wants the first mention in the text, and the heading is the first occurrence, but the actual description might be in the following text. The assistant should check if the heading is the first mention and if it includes the description. If not, proceed to the next portion. But the tool response says \\\"Decision: done\\\" with the heading as evidence. The user might need to be informed that the first mention is in the heading, but the description is in the following text. However, the assistant's previous step might have stopped too early. The correct approach is to ensure that the first paragraph describing him is found, not just the heading. Therefore, the assistant should continue scanning with the cursor to find the first paragraph that describes his character.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_z38x9gbs\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"Contains 'Звёздочкин' and 'кипел от негодования'\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"maxElements\\\":1000,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor_2\\\",\\\"startAfterPointer\\\":\\\"3:1.1.1\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1282,\"completion_tokens\":670,\"total_tokens\":1952}}\n",
