The user wants to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdochkin in the text, excluding headers. The current batch has items, and I need to check each paragraph's markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item's markdown: It talks about Znayka and his theory about lunar craters. There's a mention of Znayka and Steklyashkin observing the Moon through a telescope. Wait, the task is about Professor Zvezdochkin, but the text here mentions Znayka and Steklyashkin. No mention of Zvezdochkin here. \\n\\nThe pointer is 11:1.1.1.p8. The excerpt doesn't have Zvezdochkin's name. So, no match in this batch. Since there are more batches coming (hasMore: true), I should continue scanning. The decision should be 'continue' because the first mention might be in a later batch. No evidence found here, so newEvidence is empty. Therefore, the JSON should have decision 'continue' and no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":695,\"completion_tokens\":242,\"total_tokens\":937}}\n",
