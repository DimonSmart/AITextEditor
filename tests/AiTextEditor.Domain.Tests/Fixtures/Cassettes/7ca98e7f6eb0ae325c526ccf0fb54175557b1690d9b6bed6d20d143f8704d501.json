No mention of Фуксии here. \\n\\nNext, pointer 16:1.1.1.p13 talks about volcanoes on the Moon, again no Фуксии. \\n\\nThe third item, pointer 17:1.1.1.p14, starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which translates to \\\"Meteorites said:\\\" but there's no Фуксии here either. \\n\\nNone of the provided excerpts contain the term 'Фуксии'.
