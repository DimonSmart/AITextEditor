The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. I tried creating a cursor for all paragraphs first, then ran the agent, but it didn't find anything. Then I tried a more specific filter for paragraphs with named characters in dialogue format, but still got not_found. Maybe the dialogue isn't formatted with explicit names, or maybe the filter isn't catching it.\\n\\nPerhaps the dialogues are in a different format, like using dashes or just names without quotes. I should adjust the filter to look for any paragraphs where two names are mentioned in a way that implies dialogue. Maybe using a broader filter, like paragraphs containing two named entities. Let me try creating another cursor with a filter that looks for paragraphs with at least two named characters. That should capture more instances, including those not in the standard dialogue format.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_dwd2xpaq\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"Paragraphs containing at least two named characters\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"maxElements\\\":1000,\\\"name\\\":\\\"dialogue_cursor_v3\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1299,\"completion_tokens\":234,\"total_tokens\":1533}}\n",
