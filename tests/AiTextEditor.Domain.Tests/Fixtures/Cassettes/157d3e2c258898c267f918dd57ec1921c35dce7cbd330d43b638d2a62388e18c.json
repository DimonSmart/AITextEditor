The task: \\\"Find the first dialogue between two characters that are named in the text (e.g., lines starting with a name followed by colon or quoted speech).\\\" Return the dialogue snippet and names. But we are not to answer directly, just produce evidence from current batch.\\n\\nWe have snapshot evidenceCount=1 already, recentEvidencePointers includes \\\"14:1.1.1.p11\\\". So we should not include that pointer. In current batch, pointers: 30:..., 31:..., 32:... Need to see if any of these contain dialogue between two named characters. Let's parse each:\\n\\n30: markdown: \\\"– Вы рассуждаете так, будто вам уже когда-нибудь приходилось болтаться в центре Луны!\\\" That's a line with dash, no name.\\n\\n31: \\\"– А вы будто болтались? – огрызнулся профессор.\\\" This includes a spoken line and attribution to \\\"профессор\\\" (professor). That's one character name.\\n\\n32: \\\"– Я не болтался, – возразил Знайка, – но зато я летал в ракете и наблюдал за предметами в состоянии невесомости.\\\" This includes spoken line and attribution to \\\"Знайка\\\", a name. That's also a dialogue line with a name.\\n\\nTask: first dialogue between two characters that are named. Need two characters. In 31, we have a line spoken, and the speaker is not named before colon, but attribution \\\"- огрызнулся профессор.\\\" That's a name \\\"professor\\\". Only one character.\\n\\nIn 32, attribution to \\\"Знайка\\\". Also one.\\n\\nBut maybe the dialogue includes two characters in a single paragraph? In 31, the line is a question and then attribution, maybe there is another name, but not.\\n\\nThus none contain two named characters in same paragraph. However maybe the line includes both characters? The line is a question to \\\"you\\\": \\\"А вы будто болтались?\\\" spoken by someone; attribution \\\"профессор\\\". No second name.\\n\\nThus probably no evidence matches. So output decision \\\"continue\\\" (since more batches) and empty newEvidence array.\\n\\nMake sure not to use any pointers already in recentEvidencePointers, which we aren't.\\n\\nThus JSON with decision continue, newEvidence [].\\n\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":799,\"completion_tokens\":505,\"total_tokens\":1304}}\n",
