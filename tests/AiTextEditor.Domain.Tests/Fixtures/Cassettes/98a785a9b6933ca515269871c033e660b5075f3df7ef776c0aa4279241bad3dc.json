The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context is lines with at least two named characters in a dialogue format. The max evidence count is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items. The first item (24:1.1.1.p21) mentions Professor Zvezdochkin and Znayka's book, but there's no dialogue here. The second item (25:1.1.1.p22) talks about the professor proposing a discussion and Znayka attending, but again, no dialogue. The third item (26:1.1.1.p23) mentions the professor starting the discussion with words, but still no direct dialogue between two named characters. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first paragraph mentions Znayka's book and Professor Zvezdochkin's reaction, but no dialogue. The second paragraph mentions the professor proposing the discussion and Znayka coming. The third paragraph says the professor started speaking. There's no actual dialogue between two characters here. The task requires a dialogue, so maybe there's no evidence in this batch. But the user said to scan the current batch. Since there's no dialogue between two named characters, the decision should be 'not_found'. But wait, maybe the professor's words in the third paragraph are part of a dialogue? But it's just his speech, not a conversation with another character. So no, there's no dialogue here. Therefore, the answer is 'not_found'.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1124,\"completion_tokens\":348,\"total_tokens\":1472}}\n",
