The user wants to detect the first instance of dialogue involving two distinct named characters in the same sentence. The context mentions that it could be direct or indirect, like \\\"Alice says to Bob...\\\" or \\\"John asked Mary...\\\". Also, the sentence needs to have at least two named entities in a conversational context.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, the first item is a heading with the pointer \\\"1:1\\\" and the markdown content is \\\"# Часть I\\\". Since it's a heading, it's just a section title and doesn't contain any dialogue or named characters. The task requires checking for dialogue in the same sentence with two named characters. Since there are no items beyond this heading in the current batch, there's no content to analyze for dialogue. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and recentEvidencePointers is empty. The user's instruction says to use only the current batch's items. Since there's no relevant content here, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no evidence to report. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 1, but since there are no qualifying items, we can't meet that. So the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":656,\"completion_tokens\":268,\"total_tokens\":924}}\n",
