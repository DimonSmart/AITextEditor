The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. The context mentions paragraphs with at least two named characters. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence, with the pointer \\\"11:1.1.1.p8\\\". But since the user is providing a new batch, I need to check the current items.\\n\\nLooking at the first item in the batch: pointer \\\"15:1.1.1.p12\\\" is a paragraph, but it's in Russian. The text seems to be a question, but there's no dialogue here. The second item, pointer \\\"16:1.1.1.p13\\\", has a dialogue where \\\"Знайка\\\" (which translates to \\\"Know-it-all\\\" or a character name) is speaking. However, the paragraph mentions \\\"Знайка\\\" but doesn't have a dialogue between two named characters. The third item, pointer \\\"17:1.1.1.p14\\\", starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\", which is a group of meteorite experts speaking, but again, it's a single speaker. \\n\\nWait, maybe the first dialogue is in the second paragraph. \\\"Знайка отвечал...\\\" – here, \\\"Знайка\\\" is speaking, but there's no other named character in the same paragraph. The task requires two named characters in a dialogue. Since the snapshot's recent evidence pointer is from a previous batch, and the current batch doesn't have any dialogues between two named characters, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\". But wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first paragraph has \\\"Знайка\\\" and maybe another character? No, the first paragraph is a question from someone, but the name isn't mentioned. The second paragraph has \\\"Знайка\\\" speaking, but no other named character. The third paragraph starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили\\\", which is a group, but not two named individuals. So there's no dialogue between two named characters in the current batch. Therefore, the answer is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":805,\"completion_tokens\":466,\"total_tokens\":1271}}\n",
