The user wants the first mentions of Фуксия and Селедочка. The context is that the paragraph contains either of these names. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so we need to find the first occurrences in the current batch.\\n\\nLooking at the first item, pointer 8:1.1.1.p5. The markdown mentions \\\"учёными малышками Фуксией и Селёдочкой\\\". That's both names together. Since the task is to find the first mentions, this paragraph likely has the first occurrence. The second paragraph, pointer 9:1.1.1.p6, doesn't mention either name. So the first mention is in p5. The reason is that the excerpt directly states the names. Since the user wants the first mentions, and there's only one here, the decision should be continue because the maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't stop. But wait, the task says \\\"first mentions,\\\" so even if there's only one, we need to check if both names are mentioned here. The excerpt has both Фуксия and Селедочка, so that's two mentions. But the task might consider each name as a separate mention. However, the user might want both names in the same excerpt. Since the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and this is the first batch, we should report both names here. The newEvidence would include this pointer with the excerpt. The reason is that the paragraph mentions both names. So the JSON should have decision \\\"continue\\\" and the newEvidence array with the pointer and excerpt.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1314,\"completion_tokens\":456,\"total_tokens\":1770}}\n",
