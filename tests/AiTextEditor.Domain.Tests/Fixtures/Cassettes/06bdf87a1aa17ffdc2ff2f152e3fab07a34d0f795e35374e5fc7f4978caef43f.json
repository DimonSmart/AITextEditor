The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that all paragraphs with dialogue markers like quotes or dashes should be considered. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once we find one, we can stop.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items:\\n\\n1. The first item has a dash at the start: \\\"– Для чего понадобилась ещё эта блинистая теория...\\\" This might indicate a dialogue marker. But it's just one line, and there's no second character mentioned here. It seems like a monologue or a question, not a dialogue between two people.\\n\\n2. The second item starts with \\\"Знайка отвечал...\\\" which is a dialogue where Знайка is responding. However, the paragraph doesn't show another character's response. It's a single line of dialogue from Знайка. Since the task requires dialogue between two named characters, this might not qualify unless there's an implied other character. But the paragraph only mentions Знайка's response without another character's input.\\n\\n3. The third item starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which is a dialogue marker. But again, it's just the beginning of a statement. The paragraph doesn't include a conversation between two characters; it's more of a statement from Метеоритчики. There's no second character's dialogue here either.\\n\\nNone of the provided items have a clear dialogue between two named characters. The first item might be a monologue, the second is a single character's response, and the third is a statement. Since the task requires dialogue between two characters, and none of the current batch items show that, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\". However, the user mentioned that if the maxEvidenceCount is met, set decision to \\\"done\\\". Since the max is 1 and evidenceCount is 0, but no valid evidence found, the correct decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":795,\"completion_tokens\":424,\"total_tokens\":1219}}\n",
