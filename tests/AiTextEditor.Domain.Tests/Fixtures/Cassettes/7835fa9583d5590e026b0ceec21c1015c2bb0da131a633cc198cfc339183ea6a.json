The user wants to find the second mention of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" excluding headers. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so we start from scratch.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, each has a pointer and markdown content. I need to scan through each paragraph to find mentions of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\". Let's check each one:\\n\\nFirst item (8:1.1.1.p5) mentions Знайка and other characters but no Звёздочкина. Second item (9:1.1.1.p6) talks about Стекляшкин but not Звёздочкина. Third item (10:1.1.1.p7) discusses астрономы but again, no Звёздочкина. Fourth item (11:1.1.1.p8) mentions Знайка and Стекляшкин, but still no Звёздочкина.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. All the paragraphs in the batch don't mention \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" at all. The task is to find the second mention, but there are none in the current batch. So the answer should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there's no evidence here. The user might have expected it in a later batch, but according to the input provided, there's nothing. Therefore, the correct decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1692,\"completion_tokens\":338,\"total_tokens\":2030}}\n",
