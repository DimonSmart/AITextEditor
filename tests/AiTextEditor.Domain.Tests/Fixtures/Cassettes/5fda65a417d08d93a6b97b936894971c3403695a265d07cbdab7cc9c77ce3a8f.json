We need to find the first occurrence of a dialogue between two named characters. We need to output their names and the semantic pointer.\\n\\nWe need to create a keyword cursor. Which keywords? We can use \\\"said\\\" and \\\"asked\\\" maybe. But we need to find dialogues. Let's use keywords: \\\"said\\\", \\\"asked\\\". That will match many. But we need to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The first dialogue likely appears early in the book. Let's search for \\\"said\\\" and \\\"asked\\\". Use cursor-create_keyword_cursor with keywords [\\\"said\\\",\\\"asked\\\"]. Then read batches until we find a paragraph containing two names and dialogue. We need to identify names.
