Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to use the tools provided. The user mentioned using the chat-based cursor agent, so I should create a cursor. Since it's a keyword search, the keyword_cursor might be better. The keyword is \\\"Звёздочкин\\\", but maybe using a stem like \\\"Звёздочки\\\" to catch different forms. Wait, the function says to use word stems for matching inflected forms. So maybe \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" is the exact keyword, but the stem could be \\\"Звёздочки\\\".\\n\\nWait, the user wants the first mention, so maybe a keyword cursor with \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" and then check the pointers. Alternatively, create a cursor that filters for any mention of \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" and then find the earliest occurrence.\\n\\nBut the user said to exclude headers, so the filter should not include headers. Maybe the cursor should filter for paragraphs that contain the keyword, not headers. But how to define that? The cursor's filterDescription needs to be a stateless per-element filter. So perhaps the filter is \\\"contains 'Звёздочкин' and not a header\\\".\\n\\nWait, but how to distinguish headers from regular text? The user said to exclude headers, so maybe the filter should look for paragraphs that contain the keyword and are not headers. But without knowing the exact structure, maybe the filter is just \\\"contains 'Звёздочкин'\\\" and then the first occurrence in the document.\\n\\nAlternatively, use the keyword_cursor with \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" and then check the pointers. The first item returned by the cursor would be the first mention. But I need to make sure that headers are excluded. If the headers are marked in some way, maybe the filter can exclude them. However, without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the best approach is to create a keyword cursor with \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" and then check the pointers.\\n\\nSo, first, create a keyword cursor with the keyword \\\"Звёздочкин\\\". Then, read the cursor batch to get the first occurrence. Then, note the pointer. But the user wants the answer in Russian and include the semantic pointer. So the final answer would be the pointer location where it's first mentioned.\\n\\nWait, the user might have a specific structure in mind. Let me proceed step by step. First, create a keyword cursor for \\\"Звёздочкин\\\". Then, read the cursor batch to get the first occurrence. Then, return the pointer. But I need to make sure that the cursor is set up correctly. The keyword_cursor function takes an array of keywords. So the function call would be to create a keyword cursor with [\\\"Звёздочкин\\\"].\\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, the next step is to read the batch and find the first occurrence. Then, the answer would be the pointer of that occurrence. But since the user wants the answer in Russian, I need to present the pointer as the location. Also, the semantic pointer would be the pointer value.\\n\\nSo, the plan is: create a keyword cursor for \\\"Звёздочкин\\\", read the batch, find the first occurrence, and return the pointer in Russian.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_pk6e5o99\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"Звёздочкин\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1093,\"completion_tokens\":725,\"total_tokens\":1818}}\n",
