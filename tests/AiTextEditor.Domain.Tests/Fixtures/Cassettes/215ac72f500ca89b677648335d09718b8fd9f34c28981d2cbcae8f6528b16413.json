(исключая заголовки)\\\" which translates to \\\"Where in the book is Professor Zvezdochkin first mentioned? (excluding headers)\\\". The user wants to know the first occurrence of the professor's name in the text, not in any headers.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out the right approach. The user mentioned using specific tools, so I should follow the provided workflow. The plan is to create a cursor using keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor with the keyword \\\"звёздочкин\\\" (since the name is Звёздочкин, but the function uses lowercase stems). Then read batches to find where it's mentioned.\\n\\nWait, the user's plan already has steps: create a cursor with keywords, read batches, then finalize. The initial step is to create a keyword cursor for \\\"звёздочкин\\\". But maybe I should check if there are other possible keywords. The name is \\\"Звёздочкин\\\", so the stem would be \\\"звёздочкин\\\". Using that as the keyword should capture any mention of the name.\\n\\nNext, after creating the cursor, read batches to get the matching paragraphs. The user wants the first mention, so the earliest occurrence in the document. Since the cursor reads in portions, the first batch should contain the earliest mention. But I need to make sure that the cursor is set up correctly. Also, the user mentioned excluding headers, so maybe the filter should avoid headers? Wait, the original plan didn't include a filter, just the keyword. But the user's question says to exclude headers, so perhaps the cursor should filter out headers? However, the initial step uses keyword_cursor, which only filters by keywords. Maybe the headers are part of the document, but the user wants to exclude them. Hmm, but the user's plan didn't include a filter, so maybe the initial step is just to search for the keyword and then check the context.\\n\\nWait, the user's plan is to create a keyword cursor with \\\"звёздочкин\\\", then read batches. The first occurrence in the batches would be the answer. But the user wants to exclude headers. So maybe the cursor should have a filter that excludes headers? But the keyword_cursor doesn't have a filter parameter. The initial step uses keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor, which only has keywords. So perhaps the headers are part of the document, but the user wants to exclude them. However, the user's plan didn't include a filter, so maybe the answer is in the first batch read. Alternatively, maybe the headers are not part of the content, but the user wants to make sure that the mention isn't in a header. But since the user's plan doesn't include a filter, perhaps the answer is found in the first batch. \\n\\nSo, following the steps: create a keyword cursor for \\\"звёздочкин\\\", read the first batch, check the paragraphs, and then the answer is the first occurrence. The user's plan has step 0 as creating the cursor, step 1 and 2 as reading batches, and step 3 as finalizing. The final answer would be the pointer from the first batch where \\\"звёздочкин\\\" is mentioned. \\n\\nI need to make sure that the cursor is created correctly. The function keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor requires an array of keywords. So the arguments would be {\\\"keywords\\\": [\\\"звёздочкин\\\"]}. Then, read the first batch, which would give the earliest occurrence. If the first batch has the mention, that's the answer. If not, proceed to the next batch. But the user's plan stops at step 3, so after reading two batches, they finalize. \\n\\nSo the final answer would be the pointer from the first batch where the keyword is found. The user wants the first mention, so the earliest occurrence in the document. Therefore, the answer is the first paragraph in the first batch that contains \\\"звёздочкин\\\".\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_ct7xiv3c\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"звёздочкин\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1155,\"completion_tokens\":877,\"total_tokens\":2032}}\n",
