Continue retrieving batches until find two consecutive named dialogues? The instruction: find first dialogue between two named characters. Likely a conversation snippet containing both speakers. We need to detect a sequence where first paragraph has Name: text, second after maybe another Name: text. So we need to scan and find first occurrence of a paragraph that starts with \\\"Name:\\\" and next paragraph also starts with \\\"Name:\\\". Use agent to scan each batch. Our agent description can be generic: find first dialogue between two characters named. Already we used maxEvidenceCount=1 but would stop after first match. Might need to capture both paragraphs.
