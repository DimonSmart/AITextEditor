The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the current batch. First, I need to check each item's markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item, pointer 60:1.1.1.p57, the markdown is about someone stomping their feet on the floor. No mention of Фуксии here. \\n\\nNext, pointer 61:1.1.1.p58. The paragraph talks about Znayka's experience in a weightless environment. There's a part where he mentions his body losing weight and objects floating, but I don't see the word Фуксии. \\n\\nThen, pointer 62:1.1.1.p59. The question here is about whether the bottle had water or another drink. Still no Фуксии. \\n\\nNone of the items in this batch mention 'Фуксии'. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", which isn't in the current batch's items. Since the task is to find all mentions and the current batch has none, the decision should be 'not_found'. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't stop early. \\n\\nTherefore, the output should indicate that no new evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1029,\"completion_tokens\":291,\"total_tokens\":1320}}\n",
