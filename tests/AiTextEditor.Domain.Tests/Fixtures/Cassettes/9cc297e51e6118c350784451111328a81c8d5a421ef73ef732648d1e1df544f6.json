The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the current batch. First, I need to check each item's markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer 51:1.1.1.p48: The text talks about two small guys grabbing Zvezdokhin and Znayka, but there's no mention of Фуксии here. \\n\\nNext, pointer 52:1.1.1.p49: The paragraph mentions Znayka giving a report and people shouting \\\"Долой Звёздочкина!\\\" Still no Фуксии.\\n\\nThird item, pointer 53:1.1.1.p50: Znayka is on the tribune, saying he can't do the report because he wasn't prepared. Again, no Фуксии here. \\n\\nNone of the paragraphs in the current batch mention 'Фуксии'. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include 8:1.1.1.p5, which is from a previous batch. Since the current batch doesn't have any matches, the decision should be 'not_found'. Also, the user's task allows up to 10 evidences, but since there are none in this batch, the output is newEvidence empty and decision not_found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":802,\"completion_tokens\":297,\"total_tokens\":1099}}\n",
