The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the current batch. First, I need to check each item's markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer 63:1.1.1.p60, the markdown is about water. No mention of Фуксии here. The second item, 64:1.1.1.p61, talks about citrus or kerosine. Still nothing. The third item, 65:1.1.1.p62, mentions everyone laughing and another character asking a question. No sign of Фуксии anywhere.\\n\\nSince none of the items in the current batch contain 'Фуксии', there's no new evidence to add. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include 8:1.1.1.p5, which isn't in the current batch. So, the decision should be 'not_found' because there are no matches in the current items. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't need to stop here. Just report that no evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":745,\"completion_tokens\":250,\"total_tokens\":995}}\n",
