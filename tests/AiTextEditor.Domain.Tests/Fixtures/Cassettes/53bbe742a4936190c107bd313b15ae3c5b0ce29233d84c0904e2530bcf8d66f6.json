The task is to find the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" (Ponchik). The user provided a batch of paragraphs from a story involving Znayka, Foksiya, and Selyodka. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, but the user is asking for the first occurrence.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan each paragraph in the batch to see where \\\"Пончик\\\" is mentioned. Let's go through each item:\\n\\n1. The first paragraph (8:1.1.1.p5) talks about Znayka meeting Foksiya and Selyodka, but there's no mention of Ponchik here. It's about the Moon mission and the crater observations.\\n\\n2. The second paragraph (9:1.1.1.p6) discusses Znayka's return and his stories, but again, no Ponchik. It's about the lunar surface and craters.\\n\\n3. The third paragraph (10:1.1.1.p7) mentions the debate between the volcanic and meteorite theories. Still no Ponchik.\\n\\n4. The fourth paragraph (11:1.1.1.p8) talks about Znayka's own theory about the craters, comparing the Moon's surface to a pancake. Wait, here's a mention of \\\"блины\\\" (pancakes), but not Ponchik. However, the user's snapshot already has an evidence pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", which isn't in the current batch. The current batch starts from p5. Since the snapshot's evidence is from a previous batch, maybe the first mention is in a previous batch that's not included here. But the user's current input only has the first batch (firstBatch: false, hasMoreBatches: true), so maybe there are more batches coming. However, the task is to scan only the current batch. Since the current batch doesn't have any mention of Ponchik, and the snapshot's evidence is from a previous batch, but the user is asking for the first occurrence, which might be in an earlier batch not provided here. But according to the rules, I can only use the current batch. Since there's no mention here, the decision would be \\\"continue\\\" because there might be more batches. However, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 1, which might be from a previous batch. But the user's current batch doesn't have any Ponchik mentions. Therefore, the correct decision is \\\"continue\\\" because the first mention might be in a subsequent batch. But wait, the user's task is to find the first occurrence, and the snapshot already has an evidence pointer. However, the current batch doesn't include that pointer. So maybe the first mention is in a previous batch, but since the current batch doesn't have it, the answer would be \\\"not_found\\\" if there are no more batches. But the hasMoreBatches is true, so we can't conclude yet. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" to keep scanning.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1777,\"completion_tokens\":655,\"total_tokens\":2432}}\n",
