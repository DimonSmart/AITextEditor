The user wants to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokin being described as \\\"кипевший от негодования\\\" (boiling with anger) and briefly describe his character. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check the current batch's items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so there's no prior evidence to exclude. The batch has four paragraphs with pointers from 8:1.1.1.p5 to 11:1.1.1.p8.\\n\\nLooking through each paragraph's markdown content:\\n\\n- The first paragraph (8:1.1.1.p5) talks about Znayka's trip to the Sun City and his friends Fuxiya and Selyodka. No mention of Professor Zvezdokin here.\\n- The second paragraph (9:1.1.1.p6) mentions Steklyashkin, an astronomer, but not Zvezdokin.\\n- The third paragraph (10:1.1.1.p7) discusses astronomers in Sun City arguing about the origin of lunar craters, splitting into two groups. Still no Zvezdokin.\\n- The fourth paragraph (11:1.1.1.p8) talks about Znayka's own theory and his observations of pancakes. Again, no Zvezdokin.\\n\\nWait, the task is about Professor Zvezdokin, but none of the paragraphs mention him. The user might have a typo, maybe they meant Znayka? But the task specifically says Zvezdokin. Since the current batch doesn't have any mention of him, the answer would be \\\"not_found\\\". However, the user might have intended Znayka, but I have to stick strictly to the given text. So, no evidence found in this batch. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required mention isn't present here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1701,\"completion_tokens\":415,\"total_tokens\":2116}}\n",
