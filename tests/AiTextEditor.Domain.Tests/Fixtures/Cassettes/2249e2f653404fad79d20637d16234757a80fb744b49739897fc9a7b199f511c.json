The user wants the second mention of профессора Звёздочкина, excluding headers. The snapshot shows that there's already one evidence pointer: \\\"25:1.1.1.p22\\\". But wait, looking at the provided batch items, none of the pointers match that. Maybe that's from a previous batch. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the current batch's items. Let's go through each paragraph:\\n\\n- Pointer 39: Mentions Звёздочкин in the middle. Wait, no, the first mention here is in paragraph 42: \\\"усмехнулся Звёздочкин.\\\" That's the first mention. Then, in paragraph 44: \\\"профессор\\\" is mentioned, but that's a different person. Wait, the task is about профессора Звёздочкина. So the first mention is in 42, then the next would be in 44? Wait, no. Let me check again.\\n\\nWait, the first mention is in paragraph 42: \\\"усмехнулся Звёздочкин.\\\" Then, in paragraph 44, the user says \\\"профессор\\\" but that's a different person. Wait, no. Wait, the user is looking for mentions of профессора Звёздочкина. So the first mention is in paragraph 42: \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" is mentioned, but is he referred to as профессор here? Let me check the exact text.\\n\\nLooking at paragraph 42: \\\"– Вот видите, сами говорите – жидкость, – усмехнулся Звёздочкин. – Откуда же в Луне взялась пустота, если там была жидкость, садовая вы голова?\\\" Here, Звёздочкин is mentioned, but is he called профессор? No, the title \\\"профессор\\\" is used in paragraph 44: \\\"– Надо полагать, знаю, – сердито буркнул профессор.\\\" So that's the second mention, but the user wants the second mention of профессора Звёздочкина. Wait, maybe the first mention is in paragraph 42 where he's referred to as Звёздочкин, and the second mention is in paragraph 44 where he's called профессор. But the task says to exclude headers, so maybe the first mention is in 42, and the second is in 44. But the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers has \\\"25:1.1.1.p22\\\", which isn't in the current batch. So the user is asking for the second mention, which would be the one in 44. But wait, the first mention is in 42, then the second is in 44. So the answer should be the pointer 44:1.1.1.p41. But the user's snapshot has evidenceCount 1, which might mean that the first mention was already counted. So the current task is to find the second mention. Therefore, the newEvidence should be the pointer 44:1.1.1.p41, which mentions \\\"профессор\\\". But wait, the task is to find the second mention of профессора Звёздочкина. So the first mention is in 42 (Звёздочкин), and the second is in 44 (профессор). So that's the second mention. Therefore, the newEvidence should be pointer 44:1.1.1.p41, excerpt is \\\"– Надо полагать, знаю, – сердито буркнул профессор.\\\" The reason is that the excerpt mentions \\\"профессор\\\", which is part of the task's target. So the JSON should have decision \\\"continue\\\" and newEvidence with that pointer and excerpt.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2226,\"completion_tokens\":929,\"total_tokens\":3155}}\n",
