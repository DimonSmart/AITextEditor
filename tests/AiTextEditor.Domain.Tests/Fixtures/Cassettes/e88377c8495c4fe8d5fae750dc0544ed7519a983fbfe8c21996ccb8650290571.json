The task is to find the first mention of Fuchs in the text. The user provided a batch of items with pointers and markdown content. First, I need to scan through each item's markdown to see if \\\"Фуксия\\\" (Fuchsia, assuming that's the correct transliteration) is mentioned.\\n\\nLooking at the pointers, the recent evidence pointers from the snapshot are \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\" and \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\". But the current batch starts from pointer \\\"74:1.1.1.p71\\\" onwards. The user said not to include any pointers from the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers, so I need to check the current batch items.\\n\\nGoing through each paragraph in the current batch:\\n\\n- 74:1.1.1.p71: Talks about Звёздочкин, no Fuchs.\\n- 75:1.1.1.p72: \\\"Долой!\\\" – no.\\n- 76:1.1.1.p73: Mentions Звёздочкин again, no.\\n- 77:1.1.1.p74: Same as above.\\n- 78:1.1.1.p75: Звёздочкин's reaction, no.\\n- 79:1.1.1.p76: He mentions writing to the newspaper, but no Fuchs.\\n- 80:1.1.1.p77: Still about Звёздочкин.\\n- 81:1.1.1.p78: Closing the meeting, no.\\n- 82:1.1.1.p79: He goes home.\\n- 83:1.2: Heading, not relevant.\\n- 84:1.2.1: Heading again.\\n- 85:1.2.1.p1: Talks about the newspaper report, but no Fuchs. Wait, the user's task is about Fuchsia, but the text here mentions Знайка (Znayka) and other characters. Maybe there's a mention in the next paragraph? But the sample cuts off at 86:1.2.1.p2. However, the user's input shows that the current batch's items end at 86:1.2.1.p2, which is truncated. Since the user hasn't provided the full content, maybe there's a mention in the next paragraph that's cut off. But according to the given data, there's no mention of Фуксия in any of the provided markdowns. Therefore, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\" because none of the current batch items contain the required mention. Wait, but the task says \\\"first mention,\\\" and if the previous batches had evidenceCount 2, maybe the current batch doesn't have any new evidence. So the answer is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1476,\"completion_tokens\":639,\"total_tokens\":2115}}\n",
