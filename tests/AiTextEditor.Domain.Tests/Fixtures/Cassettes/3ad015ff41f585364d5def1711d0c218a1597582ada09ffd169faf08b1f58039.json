The user wants to know where in the book the professor Zvezdochkin is first mentioned, excluding headers. First, I need to figure out the right approach.\\n\\nThe user provided tools, so I should use them. The goal is to find the first mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" in the document. Since the user mentioned excluding headers, I need to make sure the cursor doesn't include headings. \\n\\nLooking at the tools, there's cursor-create_keyword_cursor which searches for keywords. The keywords should be \\\"профессор\\\" and \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" in lowercase stems. Wait, the user said to use lowercase word stems to cover inflected forms. So maybe \\\"профессор\\\" and \\\"звёздочкин\\\" as the keywords. \\n\\nI should create a keyword cursor with those keywords. Then read batches until I find the first occurrence. But I need to make sure that the cursor doesn't include headings. The includeHeadings parameter in cursor-create_keyword_cursor defaults to true, so I should set it to false to exclude headers.\\n\\nWait, the user's question says \\\"исключая заголовки\\\" which means excluding headers. So in the cursor creation, includeHeadings should be false. Let me check the parameters for cursor-create_keyword_cursor. Yes, there's an includeHeadings parameter. So I'll set that to false.\\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, I'll read batches using cursor-read_cursor_batch. Each batch will give me items in order. I need to check each item's text to find the first mention. Since the user wants the first occurrence, I'll process each batch in order and stop when I find the first match.\\n\\nBut how do I know when to stop? The step limit is 128, so I need to read batches until I find the answer or reach the limit. Also, the user mentioned to check previous evidence, so if the answer is in a previous batch, I should note that.\\n\\nSo the plan is: create a keyword cursor with keywords \\\"профессор\\\" and \\\"звёздочкин\\\", includeHeadings false. Then read batches, check each item's text for the mention, and once found, record the pointer. The first occurrence in the document (excluding headers) is the answer.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_g0tnhyxv\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"includeHeadings\\\":false,\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"профессор\\\",\\\"звёздочкин\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1161,\"completion_tokens\":519,\"total_tokens\":1680}}\n",
