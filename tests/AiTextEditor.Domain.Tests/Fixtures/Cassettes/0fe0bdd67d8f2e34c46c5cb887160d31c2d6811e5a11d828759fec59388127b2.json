The user is asking where in the document it's mentioned that Znayka stayed on the Moon for about four hours and had to return urgently due to air issues. First, I need to figure out which part of the text refers to this event.\\n\\nSince the user mentioned \\\"Знайка\\\" (Znayka), I should look for sections in the book that discuss his lunar activities. The book might have a specific chapter or paragraph detailing his mission. The key points here are the duration (four hours) and the reason for returning (air problem). \\n\\nI'll start by using the CursorAgentPlugin-run_cursor_agent function to search for the relevant information. The task description should be precise, so I'll set the task to find mentions of Znayka's time on the Moon and the reason for his return. I'll include the pointerLabel and pointer in the summary to locate the exact paragraph. \\n\\nWait, the user wants the first paragraph that matches, not the heading. So I need to make sure the cursor starts after the relevant pointer. If the initial search doesn't find it, I might need to adjust the startAfterPointer parameter. But since I don't have the document's structure, I'll proceed with the first search. \\n\\nI should also check if the document has any sections about lunar expeditions or Znayka's missions. If the answer isn't found in the initial search, I'll have to inform the user that it's not present in the document. Let's proceed with the function call.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_1weyxl29\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"CursorAgentPlugin-run_cursor_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"context\\\":\\\"Исследование лунной экспедиции Знайки\\\",\\\"startAfterPointer\\\":\\\"pointer://ch02-s04\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Найти упоминание о том, что Знайка пробыл на Луне около четырёх часов и вернулся из-за проблем с воздухом\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":377,\"completion_tokens\":423,\"total_tokens\":800}}\n",
