The user is asking where in the book the professor Zvezdочкиn is first mentioned, excluding headings. \\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search for mentions of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". I'll use the mcp-create_cursor function with the description to find that term. Then, I'll run the agent to iterate through the document.\\n\\nLooking at the response from the tool, the first relevant excerpt is at pointer 24:1.1.1.p21. The text mentions \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" in a paragraph discussing the professor's role and interactions. Since the user wants the first mention, this should be the answer. I need to make sure it's not a heading, and the excerpt provided doesn't seem to be a heading. \\n\\nI should check if there are any earlier pointers, but the tool's response shows that the first match is at 24:1.1.1.p21. So, the answer is there. I'll format the response in Russian, include the pointer label, and the excerpt.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_jcehoc2y\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":16743,\"completion_tokens\":262,\"total_tokens\":17005}}\n",
