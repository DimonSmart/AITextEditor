The task is to find the first mention of 'профессор Звёздочкин' in the text content, excluding headers. The user provided a batch of items, each with a pointer and markdown content. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through each item's markdown to check if 'профессор Звёздочкин' appears. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, with pointer \\\"4:1.1.1.p1\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch's items start from pointer \\\"12:1.1.1.p9\\\" onwards.\\n\\nLooking through each paragraph:\\n\\n1. The first item (12:1.1.1.p9) talks about Знайка and the Moon's surface, but no mention of профессор Звёздочкин.\\n2. The next paragraphs (13-23) discuss various theories about the Moon's craters, Знайка's theories, and the lunar inhabitants. None of these mention профессор Звёздочкин. \\n\\nWait, the user's input might have a typo. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers includes \\\"4:1.1.1.p1\\\", but in the current batch, the pointers start at 12. Maybe there's a mix-up. However, the task says to only use the current batch. Since none of the current batch's items mention 'профессор Звёздочкин', the answer would be 'not_found'. But the user's snapshot shows evidenceCount is 1, which might be from a previous batch. Since the current batch doesn't have the mention, the decision is 'not_found'.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2297,\"completion_tokens\":374,\"total_tokens\":2671}}\n",
