Let me start by recalling the tools available. The keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor function is the right choice here since it's designed to find occurrences of specific keywords. The user wants the first mention, so I need to make sure the cursor is set up to find the earliest occurrence.\\n\\nFirst, I'll use the keyword_cursor with the keyword \\\"профессор звёздочкин\\\". The function should return all instances where this keyword appears. Since the user wants the first mention, I'll need to check the order of the results. However, the cursor might return matches in the order they appear in the document, so the first item in the result should be the first mention.\\n\\nWait, but the user mentioned excluding headers. The tool's description says it locates keywords in the document, but I need to ensure that the headers aren't included. The function might not differentiate between headers and content, so maybe the initial search includes all sections. However, the user specified to exclude headers, so I should check if the first occurrence is within the main text. If the first result is a header, I need to look for the next occurrence in the body text. But how can I determine if a match is in a header or the main content? The tool's response might include pointers, which could indicate the position in the document. If the first match is in a header, I'll have to find the next one in the body. Alternatively, maybe the initial search already excludes headers, but the user's instruction is to exclude them, so I need to verify that. \\n\\nAssuming the keyword cursor returns matches in the order they appear in the document, the first occurrence in the body text would be the answer. If the first match is a header, the next one would be the correct one. Since the user wants the first mention excluding headers, I'll have to check the context of the first match. If the first match is in the main text, that's the answer. If not, the next one. The tool's response will provide the pointers, so I can check the context around those pointers to confirm if it's a header or not. \\n\\nIn the previous step, the assistant called the keyword_cursor with the keyword, and the response was \\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\". Now, I need to read the next portion from the cursor to get the actual matches. Using the chat_cursor_tools-read_cursor_batch function with the cursor name \\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\" will retrieve the items. The first item's pointer will indicate the location in the document. Once I have the pointer, I can check the surrounding text to ensure it's not a header. If it is, I'll look for the next occurrence. The answer should be the first occurrence in the main text, so I'll need to process the results accordingly.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_e3fe63q5\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"chat_cursor_tools-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":941,\"completion_tokens\":625,\"total_tokens\":1566}}\n",
