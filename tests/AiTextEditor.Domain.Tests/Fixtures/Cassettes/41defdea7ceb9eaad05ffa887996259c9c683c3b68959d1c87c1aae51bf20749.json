The user wants me to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the document. First, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence with pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but since the current batch doesn't include that pointer, I can ignore it.\\n\\nLooking at each item's markdown content:\\n\\n1. The first paragraph (12:1.1.1.p9) talks about the Moon's surface and bubbles but doesn't mention Фуксии.\\n2. The next paragraphs (13:1.1.1.p10 to 18:1.1.1.p15) discuss astronomers, volcanologists, and meteoritologists, but no Фуксии here.\\n3. Paragraph 19:1.1.1.p16 mentions \\\"блинистом\\\" which is related to the \\\"блины\\\" theory, but not Фуксии.\\n4. Paragraph 20:1.1.1.p17 refers to \\\"блинистом\\\" again, but still no Фуксии.\\n5. The rest of the paragraphs (21:1.1.1.p18 to 23:1.1.1.p20) talk about Знайка's theories and lunar inhabitants, but again, no mention of Фуксии.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The task is to find \\\"Фуксии\\\", which is a Russian word. The user provided a snapshot with a pointer that's not in the current batch. The current batch's items don't have any mention of Фуксии. So, there are no new evidence points here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there's no occurrence in the current batch. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 100, but since there are no new matches, the decision remains not_found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2318,\"completion_tokens\":429,\"total_tokens\":2747}}\n",
