The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions lines with dialogue markers or character names. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find just one instance.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, the items are all headings. The first item is a main heading, then a chapter heading, and finally a section heading. None of these seem to contain dialogue. The task specifies that the evidence must come from the current batch, and since all items here are headings without any dialogue markers or character names, there's no relevant evidence here. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and the recentEvidencePointers are empty. Since there are no dialogues in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":664,\"completion_tokens\":175,\"total_tokens\":839}}\n",
