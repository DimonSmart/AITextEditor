The task is to find the first mention of \\\"Fuchs\\\" in the given batch. The user provided a snapshot with evidenceCount 1 and a recentEvidencePointer. But since the current batch doesn't have any items with \\\"Fuchs\\\" in their markdown content, I need to check each paragraph carefully.\\n\\nLooking at the items: the first paragraph mentions \\\"блинистая теория\\\" and lunar craters, but no Fuchs. The second paragraph talks about volcanoes and lunar craters again, still no Fuchs. The third paragraph starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which translates to \\\"Meteorites said...\\\" but again, no mention of Fuchs. \\n\\nSince none of the current batch items contain \\\"Fuchs,\\\" the decision should be \\\"not_found.\\\" The newEvidence array will be empty because there are no matches. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointer is from a previous batch, so it's not considered here. The user's instruction says to only use the current batch, so even if there was a previous mention, it's irrelevant here. Therefore, the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":793,\"completion_tokens\":256,\"total_tokens\":1049}}\n",
