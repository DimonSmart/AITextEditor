The user wants to find the last mention of \\\"Фуксии\\\" (which is \\\"Fuksiya\\\" in Russian). The snapshot shows that there are no previous evidence pointers, so I need to look through the current batch items.\\n\\nFirst, I'll go through each item's markdown content. The first item (8:1.1.1.p5) mentions Фуксия and Селёдочкой. That's one mention. The next items (9:1.1.1.p6 and 10:1.1.1.p7) don't have Фуксии. The last item is 11:1.1.1.p8, which doesn't mention her either. \\n\\nWait, the first item is the only one with Фуксия. But the user wants the last mention. Since there's only one mention in the current batch, that's the last one. I need to check if there are any other mentions I might have missed. Let me scan again. No, the other paragraphs don't have her name. So the only occurrence is in the first paragraph. Therefore, the new evidence should be that pointer with the excerpt. Since the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers are empty, this is a new evidence. The reason is that the excerpt mentions Фуксия in the context of the story. So the JSON should include this pointer, excerpt, and reason.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1665,\"completion_tokens\":416,\"total_tokens\":2081}}\n",
