The user wants the first direct dialogue with two named characters in the same sentence. The context mentions examples like 'Alice says to Bob: Hello' or 'John: Hi, Mary!'. So I need to look for direct speech where two named characters are mentioned in the same sentence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, the first item is a heading: \\\"# Часть I\\\". That's just a section title, no dialogue here. The user mentioned that the firstBatch is true and there might be more batches coming. But since the current batch only has this heading, there's no actual dialogue content to extract. \\n\\nThe snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty. Since there are no items with dialogue in this batch, the decision should be 'not_found'. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 1, but without any relevant evidence in the current batch, we can't fulfill the task. So the correct response is to indicate that no evidence was found here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":635,\"completion_tokens\":222,\"total_tokens\":857}}\n",
