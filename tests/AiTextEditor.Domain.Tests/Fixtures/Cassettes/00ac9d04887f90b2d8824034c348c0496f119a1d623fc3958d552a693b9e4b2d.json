Они упоминаются впервые в параграфе с семантическим указателем **8:1.1.1.p5**.  \\nStop reason: `goal_reached`\",\"reasoning\":\"Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking who Фуксия and Селедочка are and where they are first mentioned. \\n\\nFirst, I need to find the earliest occurrence of these names in the document. The user mentioned using the cursor tools, so I'll start by creating a keyword cursor with the names \\\"фуксия\\\" and \\\"селедочка\\\". The function call was already made, and the response included a batch of items. \\n\\nLooking at the first item's semantic pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", the paragraph there mentions that Знайка met Фуксия and Селёдочка in the Солнечный город while preparing their second lunar flight. This seems like the first mention since it's part of the initial batch. The second item at \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\" refers to a later part where they're discussing the moon rock, but the first mention is in the p5 paragraph.\\n\\nI should check if there's any earlier mention, but since the cursor returned items starting from p5 and the next pointer is p67, it's likely that p5 is the first occurrence. The answer should state that they are scientists from the Солнечный город, mentioned first in paragraph 8:1.1.1.p5. The stop reason is goal_reached because the information is found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1829,\"completion_tokens\":381,\"total_tokens\":2210}}\n",
