The user wants to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokin, excluding headers. The cursor name provided is keyword_cursor_0, and the max evidence count is 1. \\n\\nFirst, I need to use the keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor function with the keyword \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" to create a cursor that locates instances of this name in the document. Since the task is to find the first occurrence, the cursor should return items in order, and the first one that's not a header should be the answer.\\n\\nWait, but the user mentioned excluding headers. The initial setup might include headers, so I need to ensure that the cursor filters out headers. However, the keyword cursor might not handle headers specifically. Maybe the read_cursor_batch function will return items with pointers, and I can check each item's position to skip headers. But the user wants the first mention, so perhaps the first item after headers is the answer.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the cursor is already set up to ignore headers. The task description says to exclude headers, so the cursor should be configured to skip them. But the keyword cursor's parameters only take keywords. Hmm. Maybe the initial setup of the cursor includes a filter to exclude headers. Wait, the cursor-create_cursor function allows a filterDescription. But the user is using keyword_cursor, which might not have that. \\n\\nWait, the user is using the keyword_cursor, which is different from the regular cursor. The keyword_cursor's description says it yields matching document items in order. So it's possible that headers are included unless specified otherwise. Therefore, after retrieving the first item, I need to check if it's a header. If it is, skip to the next. But since the maxEvidenceCount is 1, maybe the first non-header mention is the answer. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the cursor is set up to ignore headers. The user might have already configured that. Since the task is to find the first mention, I'll proceed by reading the first batch using read_cursor_batch with the keyword cursor. Then, check each item's pointer to determine if it's a header. If not, that's the answer. If it is, continue until a non-header is found. But since the maxEvidenceCount is 1, maybe the first item is the answer. \\n\\nWait, the user's task says to exclude headers, so the cursor might need to filter them. However, the keyword cursor might not have that capability. Therefore, after retrieving the first item, I need to verify if it's a header. If it is, the answer would be the next item. But since the maxEvidenceCount is 1, maybe the first non-header is the answer. \\n\\nIn any case, the first step is to create the keyword cursor with the keyword \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" and then read the first batch. Then, check each item's pointer to see if it's a header. If not, that's the answer. If it is, continue. But given the constraints, the first item is likely the answer. So I'll proceed with creating the keyword cursor and reading the first batch.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_yx1xe6xl\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"Звёздочкин\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":949,\"completion_tokens\":678,\"total_tokens\":1627}}\n",
