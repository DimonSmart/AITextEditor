The user wants me to find the first mention of a clothing factory producing rubber bras and synthetic fur coats. The context is paragraphs mentioning 'одёжная фабрика' and listing products from rubber bras to synthetic fur coats. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 1, and the recentEvidencePointer is \\\"5:1.1.1.p2\\\". But the current batch items don't seem to have any mention of 'одёжная фабрика' or the products listed. The paragraphs in the batch are about lunar craters and volcanoes, not clothing factories. So, there's no relevant evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since none of the current items match the task's requirements.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":822,\"completion_tokens\":170,\"total_tokens\":992}}\n",
