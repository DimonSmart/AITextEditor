I need to use the cursor-create_cursor function to create a cursor that looks for mentions of 'Ponchik'. The filter description should be \\\"mentions of 'Ponchik'\\\". Since they want the first mention, I'll set maxEvidenceCount to 1. The cursor name will be \\\"search_cursor\\\".\\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, the next step is to run the agent using run_agent with the cursor name and task description to find the first mention. The task description should be something like \\\"Find the first mention of Ponchik\\\". \\n\\nAfter running the agent, the response will give the evidence item. I need to check if the cursor is complete or if there are more results. If the first item contains the mention, I should extract the paragraph and the pointer label. If not, continue searching. But since maxEvidenceCount is 1, it should stop after the first result. Then, present the answer in Russian with the pointer included.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_ix78vrqx\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of Ponchik\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1172,\"completion_tokens\":258,\"total_tokens\":1430}}\n",
