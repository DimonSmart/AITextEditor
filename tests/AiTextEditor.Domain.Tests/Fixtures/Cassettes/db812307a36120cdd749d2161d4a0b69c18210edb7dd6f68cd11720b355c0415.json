The user is asking for the location of the fourth mention of Professor Zvezdochkin in the book, excluding headers. \\n\\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the task correctly. The user wants the fourth occurrence of the professor's name, not counting any headers. So, I should focus on paragraphs and not headings.\\n\\nLooking back at the previous steps, the assistant created a keyword cursor with \\\"звёздочкин\\\" and read batches. The responses included several paragraphs where the professor is mentioned. Let me check each mention:\\n\\n1. The first mention is in paragraph 21 (SemanticPointer 24:1.1.1.p21) where he reacts to the book.\\n2. The second mention is in paragraph 22 (25:1.1.1.p22) as he proposes the discussion.\\n3. The third mention is in paragraph 23 (26:1.1.1.p23) when he starts his speech.\\n4. The fourth mention is in paragraph 32 (35:1.1.1.p32) where he criticizes someone's comparison.\\n\\nWait, but looking at the latest tool response, the items include SemanticPointer 79:1.1.1.p76 where he's being dragged out, but that's after the fourth mention. Let me recount:\\n\\nFrom the batches read:\\n- First batch: 21, 22, 23 (three mentions)\\n- Second batch: 25, 32, 34 (three more, total six? Wait, no. Wait, the first batch had three items, then the next batches added more. Let me list each mention:\\n\\n1. 24:1.1.1.p21\\n2. 25:1.1.1.p22\\n3. 26:1.1.1.p23\\n4. 28:1.1.1.p25\\n5. 35:1.1.1.p32\\n6. 37:1.1.1.p34\\n7. 42:1.1.1.p39\\n8. 50:1.1.1.p47\\n9. 51:1.1.1.p48\\n10. 52:1.1.1.p49\\n11. 70:1.1.1.p67\\n12. 71:1.1.1.p68\\n13. 73:1.1.1.p70\\n14. 74:1.1.1.p71\\n15. 76:1.1.1.p73\\n16. 78:1.1.1.p75\\n17. 79:1.1.1.p76\\n\\nWait, but the user is asking for the fourth mention. Let me check each occurrence:\\n\\n1. First mention: p21\\n2. Second: p22\\n3. Third: p23\\n4. Fourth: p25 (from the second batch)\\nWait, but in the second batch, the items were p25, p32, p34. So p25 is the fourth mention. Then p32 is fifth, p34 sixth. Then in the third batch, p39 is seventh, etc. So the fourth mention is in p25, which is SemanticPointer 28:1.1.1.p25. But wait, the user is asking for the fourth mention. Let me confirm:\\n\\nLooking at the first three paragraphs (21, 22, 23) that's three mentions. Then the next batch includes p25 (fourth), p32 (fifth), p34 (sixth). So the fourth mention is in p25. But the user's question is about the fourth mention. However, in the latest tool response, the assistant is still reading batches. Wait, but the last tool response had HasMore: false, so no more batches. So the fourth mention is in p25. But let me check the exact text:\\n\\nIn p25: \\\"После этого профессор Звёздочкин громко откашлялся...\\\" which is the fourth mention. So the answer should be SemanticPointer 28:1.1.1.p25. But wait, the user might have counted differently. Let me check again:\\n\\n1. p21: first mention\\n2. p22: second\\n3. p23: third\\n4. p25: fourth\\nYes. So the fourth mention is in p25. Therefore, the answer is SemanticPointer 28:1.1.1.p25.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_2v78zaia\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":3737,\"completion_tokens\":1065,\"total_tokens\":4802}}\n",
