Let me start by recalling the previous steps. The assistant first created a cursor to search for mentions of Professor Zvezdochin, and then ran the agent to find the first mention. The first mention was found in the excerpt where Professor Zvezdochin is described as a member of the academy and his reaction to the book.\\n\\nNow, the user wants the second mention. Since the first mention was found at pointer 24:1.1.1.p21, I need to continue searching from there. The next step is to run the agent again with the same cursor but instructing it to find the next occurrence. The function mcp-run_agent can be used here by specifying the cursor name and a task description to look for the next mention. \\n\\nI should make sure that the task description clearly asks for the next mention after the first one. The response from the previous run indicated that there are more items available, so the agent should continue searching. Once the second mention is found, the assistant should return the relevant paragraph and the pointer label. If there's no more content, it should inform the user that it's not found. Let me structure the tool call accordingly.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_0yurt8pr\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the second mention of профессора Звёздочкина (excluding headers)\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1271,\"completion_tokens\":314,\"total_tokens\":1585}}\n",
