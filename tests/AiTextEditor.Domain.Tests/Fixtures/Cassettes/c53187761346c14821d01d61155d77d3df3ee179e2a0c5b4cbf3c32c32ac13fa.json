We have many excerpts; we saw one occurrence earlier: In item where text includes \\\u0022\u043A\u0430\u043A \u043E\u043D\u0438 \u0441 \u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0421\u0435\u043B\u0451\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u043E\u0439 \u043F\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043E\u0432\u0430\u043B\u0438\\\u0022. That\u0027s \\\u0022\u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0435\u0439\\\u0022 (instrumental case). The word is \\\u0022\u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u044F\\\u0022 maybe same root. We need exact word \\\u0022\u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0438\\\u0022 (genitive singular maybe). Check occurrences.\\n\\nSearch earlier: The excerpt shows \\\u0022\u043A\u0430\u043A \u043E\u043D\u0438 \u0441 \u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0435\u0439\\\u0022.

Continue scanning later items: No other mention of \u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0438 seen. Maybe earlier items omitted? We haven\u0027t seen after line index 133 etc. The snippet with \u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0435\u0439 appears at line index 139, with text: \\\u0022... \u043A\u0430\u043A \u043E\u043D\u0438 \u0441 \u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0421\u0435\u043B\u0451\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u043E\u0439 \u043F\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043E\u0432\u0430\u043B\u0438\\\u0022. That\u0027s the only occurrence we saw. The task wants \\\u0022last occurrence\\\u0022 of word \\\u0022\u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0438\\\u0022. Might be a different form \\\u0022\u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0438\\\u0022. Need to verify if there is \\\u0022\u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0438\\\u0022 somewhere else in later parts that we haven\u0027t seen. In the rest of items after index 139 up to later, I didn\u0027t see any \\\u0022\u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0438\\\u0022. So probably the last occurrence is the one at line index 139, but the word there is \u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0435\u0439 (different declension). However maybe there is another later occurrence not yet seen, but we haven\u0027t reached end of document. The cursor is whole book backward, meaning we are scanning from end towards start? Possibly backward means reading from end to start, but items are being presented as we go backward; the first items were later in the book (higher line index). The later items (higher line index) correspond to later positions. The last occurrence would be the earliest (closest to the start) or the latest in the book? The phrase \\\u0022last occurrence\\\u0022 usually means the final one in the text (closest to the end). Since we are scanning backward, we are encountering later portions first? Actually backward reading yields items from later lines to earlier lines? The first items we saw have line indexes ~171 etc; later items have decreasing line indexes. So we are moving backwards indeed; the later part of the book (higher line index) is earlier in the scan? Wait line index 171 \\u003e 169 \\u003e ... down to 79. So we started at line 171 (near end). So we are scanning from near end of book backward to start (decreasing). Therefore we need to find the first occurrence as we go backward (i.e., the earliest from end). So the last occurrence overall is the latest in the book (the highest line index) that contains the word. We have not yet encountered any with \u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0438 in high line indexes; maybe later parts beyond 171 contain it but we haven\u0027t seen. The provided items start at 171 then 169 etc. No \\\u0022\u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0438\\\u0022. At 139 there is \\\u0022\u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0435\u0439\\\u0022, not \\\u0022\u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0438\\\u0022. Maybe later section after 171 will have it but hasn\u0027t been shown yet. We need to continue scanning? The instruction: respond with status continue until we find and then found. So we need to keep asking for next items? Since we haven\u0027t found \\\u0022\u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0438\\\u0022, we respond with continue, no result.\\n\\nThus output: {\\\u0022status\\\u0022:\\\u0022continue\\\u0022,\\\u0022result\\\u0022:\\\u0022\\\u0022}.\u0022},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022stop\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:10027,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:718,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:10745}}\n",
