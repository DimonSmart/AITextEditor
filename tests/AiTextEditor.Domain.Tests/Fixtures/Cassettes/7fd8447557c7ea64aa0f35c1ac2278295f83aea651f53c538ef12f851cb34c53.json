The user wants to find a description of two rotating buildings on Kolokolchikov Street with a spiral descent and a devil's wheel on the roof. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, pointer 4:1.1.1.p1, but I need to check the current batch for new evidence.\\n\\nLooking at the batch items, the pointers start from 74:1.1.1.p71 onwards. The first few paragraphs talk about Zvezdokhinn being dragged out and the meeting being closed. Then there's a heading for Chapter Two and another for the mystery of the lunar stone. \\n\\nIn paragraph 85:1.2.1.p1, there's mention of a cartoon showing the Moon with inhabitants upside down, holding onto objects. But the user is looking for specific elements: two rotating buildings, spiral descent, and a devil's wheel. The existing evidence from the snapshot might be related to the lunar inhabitants, but the current batch's paragraphs don't mention the exact terms the user is asking for. \\n\\nThe other paragraphs in the batch don't seem to have any references to rotating buildings, spiral descents, or a devil's wheel. The only mention of the Moon is in the context of the lunar inhabitants and cartoons, which might not match the specific requirements. Since none of the current batch items provide the exact description needed, the decision should be 'not_found'.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1490,\"completion_tokens\":314,\"total_tokens\":1804}}\n",
