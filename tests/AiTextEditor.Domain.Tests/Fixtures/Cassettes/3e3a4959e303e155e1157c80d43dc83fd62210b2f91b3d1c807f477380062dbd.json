The user wants to find the second mention of Professor Zvezdochin, excluding headers. The current batch has several paragraphs, so I need to scan through each one.\\n\\nFirst, I'll check each paragraph's markdown content for any reference to Professor Zvezdochin. The first paragraph mentions Znayka and other characters like Fuxiya and Selyodka, but no professor. The second paragraph talks about Steklyashkin, an astronomer, but not the professor. The third paragraph mentions astronomers in the Solar City arguing about the origin of lunar craters, but again, no professor. The fourth paragraph discusses Znayka's theory but doesn't mention the professor either. \\n\\nSince none of the paragraphs in this batch mention Professor Zvezdochin, the evidence count remains zero. The task requires the second mention, but since there's no mention at all in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" only if there are no more batches. However, the snapshot shows hasMoreBatches is true, so we need to continue scanning. Therefore, the correct decision here is \\\"continue\\\" because there might be mentions in subsequent batches.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1780,\"completion_tokens\":261,\"total_tokens\":2041}}\n",
