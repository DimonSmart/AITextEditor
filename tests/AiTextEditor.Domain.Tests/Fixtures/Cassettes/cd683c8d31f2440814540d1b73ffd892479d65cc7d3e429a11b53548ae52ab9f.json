The task is to find the second mention of профессора Звёздочкина, excluding headers. The user provided a snapshot with three previous evidence pointers, so I need to make sure not to include those. The current batch has several items, and I need to scan through them.\\n\\nFirst, I'll check each item's markdown content for mentions of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\". The previous evidence pointers are 25:1.1.1.p22, 50:1.1.1.p47, and 71:1.1.1.p68. I should ignore those. \\n\\nLooking at the items in the batch:\\n\\n- Pointer 76: Mentions Звёздочкина but it's the first mention in the text. Since the snapshot already has three, maybe this is part of the previous ones? Wait, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers are from earlier batches, so the current batch's items might have new mentions. \\n\\nWait, the task says to exclude headers, so I should skip any headings. The items with itemType Heading can be ignored. \\n\\nLooking at pointer 79: The markdown says \\\"Вы ещё узнаете профессора Звёздочкина!\\\" which is a direct mention. That's the first mention in the current batch. Then, pointer 80: \\\"Он долго так кричал...\\\" but no mention. Pointer 81: No mention. Pointer 82: No. Then pointer 84 is a heading, so skip. Pointer 85: Mentions Знайкиной книги, but not Звёздочкина. Pointer 86 is truncated. \\n\\nWait, the previous evidenceCount is 3, so the user is looking for the second mention. But the current batch's items might have the next one. Let me check again. \\n\\nWait, the user's task is to find the second mention, excluding headers. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers are from previous batches, so the current batch might have the next mention. Let me check each item again. \\n\\nLooking at pointer 79: \\\"Вы ещё узнаете профессора Звёздочкина!\\\" That's a mention. Then, is there another mention in the current batch? The next items after 79 are 80, 81, 82, which don't mention him. Then the headings 84 and 85 don't mention him. So maybe the second mention is in the current batch's pointer 79. But the snapshot's evidenceCount is 3, so maybe the user is looking for the next one after that. Wait, the task says \\\"second mention (excluding headers)\\\", so if the previous three were from earlier batches, the current batch's first mention would be the fourth, but the task is to find the second. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. \\n\\nWait, the task's goal is to find the second mention, so the user is looking for the second occurrence in the entire document, not just the current batch. But the rules say to use only the current batch's content. Wait, the evidence rules state: \\\"Use ONLY content from the CURRENT batch.\\\" So I can't look at previous batches. Therefore, the previous evidenceCount is just for the decision to continue or done, but the actual evidence extraction is based on the current batch. \\n\\nSo, in the current batch, I need to find mentions of профессора Звёздочкина, excluding headers. The previous evidence pointers are from earlier batches, so they are not part of the current batch. \\n\\nLooking through the current batch's items:\\n\\n- Pointer 76: Mentions Звёздочкина (first mention in current batch)\\n- Pointer 79: Mentions профессора Звёздочкина (second mention in current batch)\\n- Pointer 80: No mention\\n- Pointer 81: No\\n- Pointer 82: No\\n- Pointer 84: Heading, skip\\n- Pointer 85: No mention\\n\\nSo the second mention in the current batch is pointer 79. Therefore, the newEvidence should include pointer 79's excerpt. The reason is that the excerpt directly mentions профессора Звёздочкина. \\n\\nWait, but the task says \\\"second mention (excluding headers)\\\", so if the current batch has two mentions, then the second one would be the one in pointer 79. So the answer should include that. The decision would be \\\"continue\\\" if there are more mentions, but since the batch has only two, maybe \\\"done\\\" if that's the second. Wait, the user's task is to find the second mention, so once found, the decision would be \\\"done\\\". But the output schema requires \\\"decision\\\" to be continue, done, or not_found. Since the current batch has the second mention (assuming previous batches had one), then the decision would be \\\"done\\\". But the user's snapshot has evidenceCount 3, which might mean that the previous batches had three mentions, and the current batch's items might have the fourth. But the task is to find the second mention. This is confusing. \\n\\nWait, the task's goal is to find the second mention, so regardless of previous batches, the user is looking for the second occurrence in the entire document. However, the rules state that the current batch's items are the only source. Therefore, if the current batch has the second mention, then the answer is that. But the previous evidenceCount is 3, which might indicate that the user is looking for the next one. But the task is to find the second mention, so maybe the user is in the middle of a process. \\n\\nThis is a bit unclear, but according to the rules, I must only use the current batch. So in the current batch, the second mention would be pointer 79. Therefore, the newEvidence includes that, and the decision is \\\"continue\\\" if there are more mentions, or \\\"done\\\" if that's the second. But since the task is to find the second, and the current batch has it, the decision would be \\\"done\\\". However, the user might have more batches, but the input says hasMoreBatches is false. So the answer should be to include the second mention in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1410,\"completion_tokens\":1414,\"total_tokens\":2824}}\n",
