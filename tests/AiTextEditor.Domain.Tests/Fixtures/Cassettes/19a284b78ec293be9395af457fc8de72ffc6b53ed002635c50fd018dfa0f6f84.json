The user wants me to find all mentions of 'профессора Звёздочкина' in the current batch, excluding headers. The task says to look for content that includes this name and isn't a header. \\n\\nFirst, I'll check each item in the batch. The first item has a pointer 10:1.1.1.p7, which is a paragraph. The markdown there talks about astronomers arguing about lunar craters, mentioning the vulcanist and meteorite theories. There's no mention of профессора Звёздочкина here.\\n\\nThe second item is pointer 11:1.1.1.p8. The markdown here discusses Znayka's theory about lunar craters, comparing the moon's surface to a pancake. Again, no mention of профессора Звёздочкина. \\n\\nSince neither of these paragraphs include the name, and there are no headers in the provided items, there's no evidence to report. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and the recentEvidencePointers are empty. Since the current batch doesn't have any matches, the decision should be 'not_found'. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't need to check for a limit here. Therefore, the output should indicate that no new evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1109,\"completion_tokens\":294,\"total_tokens\":1403}}\n",
