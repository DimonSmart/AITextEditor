The user wants to find the first direct dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that it should be a paragraph with direct dialogue, like \\\"Alice: Hello, Bob.\\\" and focus on named entities in a conversational context.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, there's only one item with pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\". The markdown content is a paragraph in Russian. I need to check if there's any direct dialogue here. The paragraph talks about Znayka meeting the scientists Fuxiya and Selodka, and their activities on the Moon. However, I don't see any dialogue markers like colons or quotes. The text is narrative, describing their actions and the environment, but no actual conversation between characters. \\n\\nSince the task requires direct dialogue and the given text doesn't have any, there's no evidence to report. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the criteria aren't met. Also, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and adding new evidence isn't possible here. So the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with an empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":979,\"completion_tokens\":247,\"total_tokens\":1226}}\n",
