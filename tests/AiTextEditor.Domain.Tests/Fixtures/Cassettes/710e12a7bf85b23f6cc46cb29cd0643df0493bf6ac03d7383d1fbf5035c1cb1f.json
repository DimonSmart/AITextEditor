The goal is to find the first direct dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that direct dialogue is something like \\\"Alice: Hello, Bob.\\\" So I need to look for paragraphs where two named characters are speaking directly to each other.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, there's only one item with pointer \\\"7:1.1.1.p4\\\". The markdown content is a paragraph about Pончик and the smell of naphthalene. Let me read through it again. The paragraph describes how Pончик has to use naphthalene to get rid of moths, and the strong smell affects others. It mentions that when Pончик comes to someone's house, the hosts get dizzy and have to open windows. People avoid him in the yard because of the smell. \\n\\nWait, is there any direct dialogue here? The paragraph is all narrative, describing actions and effects. There's no dialogue where characters are speaking to each other. The names mentioned are Pончик and the hosts, but the interactions are described in third person. No quotes or dialogue tags. \\n\\nThe task says to look for direct dialogue between two named characters. Since the provided batch doesn't have any such dialogue, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and since there's no new evidence here, the newEvidence array remains empty. So the output should be \\\"decision\\\": \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":989,\"completion_tokens\":319,\"total_tokens\":1308}}\n",
