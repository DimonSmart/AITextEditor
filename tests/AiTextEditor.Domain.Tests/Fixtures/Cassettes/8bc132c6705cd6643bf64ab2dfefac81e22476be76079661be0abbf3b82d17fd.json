The goal is to find the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The context is paragraphs with dialogue markers mentioning Znayka and Professor. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so no previous matches. The batch has three items. Let's check each one.\\n\\nLooking at the first item (24:1.1.1.p21), the markdown mentions Professor Zvёzdочкиn's reaction to Znayka's book. He's angry, calling it \\\"чёртова чепуха\\\" (devilish nonsense). But there's no mention of the professor being stuck in the Moon's center here. Also, the dialogue is from the professor, not Znayka.\\n\\nNext, the second item (25:1.1.1.p22) talks about the professor proposing a discussion on the book. Again, no Znayka's comment here, just the professor's actions. \\n\\nThird item (26:1.1.1.p23) mentions the professor starting the discussion. Still, no dialogue from Znayka. \\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center.\\\" The key points are: Znayka's sarcastic remark, the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. \\n\\nLooking through the provided texts again. The first paragraph mentions the professor's anger but not about being stuck in the Moon. The other paragraphs don't have any dialogue from Znayka. \\n\\nHmm, maybe there's a mention in the first paragraph where the professor says the book is nonsense, but that's not a sarcastic comment from Znayka. The task requires Znayka's comment, not the professor's. \\n\\nSince none of the items in the current batch have Znayka's dialogue about the professor being stuck in the Moon's center, the answer would be \\\"not_found.\\\" But wait, the user's instruction says to output exactly one JSON object. If there's no evidence, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" and newEvidence is empty. \\n\\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first paragraph's markdown says the professor is \\\"вовсе не книга, а какая-то, как он выразился, чёртова чепуха.\\\" That's the professor's comment, not Znayka's. Znayka hasn't commented here. \\n\\nSo, there's no evidence in the current batch. Therefore, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1139,\"completion_tokens\":584,\"total_tokens\":1723}}\n",
