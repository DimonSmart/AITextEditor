The user wants the first mention of Фуксия and Селедочка. The context is all paragraphs, and the maxEvidenceCount is null, so we need to find all instances but since the goal is the first mention, maybe we need to check each paragraph in order.\\n\\nLooking at the snapshot, the evidenceCount is 1, and the recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\". But the current batch starts with pointer \\\"12:1.1.1.p9\\\". Wait, the pointers in the batch are 12, 13, 14. The previous evidence was from 8, which isn't in this batch. So, in this batch, we need to check each item's markdown for Фуксия or Селедочка.\\n\\nFirst item: pointer 12:1.1.1.p9. The markdown talks about the Moon's surface, lava, bubbles, etc. No mention of the names. Second item, 13:1.1.1.p10, mentions astronomers laughing at Знайкина theory. Still no. Third item, 14:1.1.1.p11, starts with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\" which is \\\"Volcanologists said:\\\" but no names here. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. The task is to find the first mention, but in the current batch, none of the paragraphs have Фуксия or Селедочка. The previous evidence was from a different batch (pointer 8), but the current batch's items don't contain the names. So, the answer would be that there's no new evidence here. But the user's instruction says to output exactly one JSON object. Since the current batch doesn't have the names, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\" or \\\"continue\\\". But according to the rules, if there's no new evidence, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\". However, the user might expect that if the first mention is in a previous batch, but the current batch doesn't have it, then the answer is not found. So the correct output is decision: \\\"not_found\\\" with no newEvidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1087,\"completion_tokens\":477,\"total_tokens\":1564}}\n",
