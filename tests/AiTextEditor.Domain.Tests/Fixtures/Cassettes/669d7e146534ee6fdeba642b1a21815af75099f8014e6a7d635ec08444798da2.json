The user wants to find the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to see if \\\"Пончик\\\" appears. \\n\\nLooking at the first item's markdown: It talks about Незнайка's trip to the Sun City and mentions Кнопочки and Пачкули Пёстренького. Wait, \\\"Пачкули Пёстренького\\\" – that's a name, but does it include \\\"Пончик\\\"? No, that's a different name. The first paragraph doesn't have \\\"Пончик\\\".\\n\\nMoving to the second item's markdown: It discusses the residents of Sun City helping with construction and mentions a factory. The text here doesn't have \\\"Пончик\\\" either. \\n\\nHmm, neither of the paragraphs in the first batch mention \\\"Пончик\\\". The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and recentEvidencePointers is empty. Since the task is to find the first mention, but the current batch doesn't have it, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, there's no new evidence to add here. So the correct response is to indicate that no evidence was found in this batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1253,\"completion_tokens\":273,\"total_tokens\":1526}}\n",
