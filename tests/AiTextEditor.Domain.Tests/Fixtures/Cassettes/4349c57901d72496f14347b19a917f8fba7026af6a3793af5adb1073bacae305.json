The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that lines should have at least two named characters in a dialogue format. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items:\\n\\n1. The first paragraph (12:1.1.1.p9) talks about Знайка's theory about the Moon's surface. It mentions Знайка but no other character in a dialogue. The paragraph is descriptive, not a conversation.\\n\\n2. The second paragraph (13:1.1.1.p10) states that all astronomers, vulcanologists, and meteoritists laughed at Знайка's theory. Here, there's a mention of multiple characters (astronomers, vulcanologists, meteoritists) but no direct dialogue. It's a statement, not a conversation between two named characters.\\n\\n3. The third paragraph (14:1.1.1.p11) starts with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\" which translates to \\\"Vulcanologists said:\\\". This is the beginning of a dialogue, but it only mentions one character (Vulcanologists) and doesn't have a second named character yet. The dialogue might continue in a subsequent batch, but since there's no more data here, this might be the only mention. However, the task requires two named characters in a dialogue. Since this paragraph only has one character mentioned, it doesn't meet the criteria.\\n\\nNone of the provided items have a dialogue between two named characters. The closest is the third paragraph starting a dialogue, but it's incomplete. Therefore, there's no valid evidence in the current batch. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" as there's no matching dialogue between two named characters.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1081,\"completion_tokens\":392,\"total_tokens\":1473}}\n",
