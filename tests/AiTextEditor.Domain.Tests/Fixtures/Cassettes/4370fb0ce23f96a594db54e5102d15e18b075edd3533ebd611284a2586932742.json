The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with two character names followed by dialogue. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, both are paragraphs. The first paragraph talks about Ponchik and others, but there's no dialogue here. The second paragraph mentions Ponchik and others, but again, it's narrative, not dialogue. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\\n\\nWait, the context says \\\"Lines with two character names followed by dialogue.\\\" So the evidence should be a line where two names are mentioned followed by their dialogue. But in the given batch items, the paragraphs are narrative, not dialogue lines. There's no line with two names and then dialogue. The first paragraph mentions Ponchik and others, but it's a narrative. The second paragraph also describes Ponchik's situation without dialogue. \\n\\nSince there's no dialogue lines in the current batch, the answer would be \\\"not_found.\\\" But wait, maybe the user considers the mention of characters in the same sentence as dialogue? No, the task specifies lines with two names followed by dialogue. Since the batch items don't have such lines, the correct decision is \\\"not_found.\\\"\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1282,\"completion_tokens\":284,\"total_tokens\":1566}}\n",
