We have been scanning lines 49 onwards. Need earlier portion. The pointer segments start at 49, 51, 53, 55 etc. So line 47 is earlier. We need to continue fetching previous items maybe. Since we have forward cursor, we need to go backward? But we only have forward. However line 47 should appear before line 49. We haven\u0027t gotten it yet. Need to request more items earlier in the document maybe by moving cursor backward? The tool only gives sequential forward from current position. The cursor is currently after line 115 etc. To get earlier lines we might need to reset cursor to start? Might be another command? Could request \\\u0022CUR_WHOLE_BOOK_BACKWARD\\\u0022? Not given. Perhaps the cursor provided is whole book forward, and we have already traversed many lines; line 47 likely already passed earlier. We might have missed it earlier in the sequence; need to scroll back in items list? The series started at line 49, so line 47 is not yet provided. Perhaps we need to request more items with earlier indices? But forward cursor only moves forward, cannot go back. So maybe the line 47 is before current pointer, but we still can get it because the cursor is still at start? Actually each batch shows items with line indices increasing. We started at line 49, then 51 etc. So line 47 hasn\u0027t been output. We need to get earlier lines by moving cursor backward? The spec only mentions \\\u0022CUR_WHOLE_BOOK_FORWARD\\\u0022. Might have \\\u0022CUR_WHOLE_BOOK_BACKWARD\\\u0022? Not provided. Could request with same cursor but maybe it resets? Could request again? Not sure.\\n\\nWe could answer with status continue, indicating need more data. That aligns with instruction: continue when not yet found.
