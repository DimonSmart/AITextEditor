The user wants the first mention of Professor Zvezdokin described as \\\"кипевший от негодования\\\" (boiling with anger) and a brief character description. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check the current batch's items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so no previous matches. The task is to find the first occurrence in the current batch.\\n\\nLooking through the provided items, all the pointers are from 12:1.1.1.p9 to 22:1.1.1.p19. The markdown content discusses Znayka's theories about the Moon's surface and interactions with volcanologists and meteoritologists. \\n\\nI need to scan each paragraph for the exact phrase \\\"кипевший от негодования.\\\" Let me go through each item:\\n\\n1. Pointer 12: Talks about the Moon's surface cooling, no mention of anger.\\n2. Pointer 13: Volcanologists laugh at Znayka's theory. No anger mentioned.\\n3. Pointer 14: Volcanologists question the need for the theory. Still no anger.\\n4. Pointer 15: Meteoritologists say craters aren't volcanoes. No anger.\\n5. Pointer 16: Znayka counters with volcanic vs. meteorite theories. No anger.\\n6. Pointer 17: Meteoritologists say craters aren't from meteorites. No anger.\\n7. Pointer 18: Znayka's theory is dismissed, called \\\"блинист.\\\" No anger.\\n8. Pointer 19: Znayka visits the Moon, sees the crater. No anger.\\n9. Pointer 20: Volcanologists and meteoritologists mock him, call him \\\"блинист.\\\" Still no anger.\\n10. Pointer 21: Znayka realizes the walls were made by intelligent beings. No anger.\\n11. Pointer 22: He publishes a book about lunar inhabitants. No anger.\\n\\nWait, none of the excerpts mention \\\"кипевший от негодования.\\\" The task requires this exact phrase. Since the current batch doesn't have it, the decision should be \\\"not_found.\\\" The user might have intended to include this phrase in a later batch, but based on the provided data, it's absent. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the evidence isn't found here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2001,\"completion_tokens\":524,\"total_tokens\":2525}}\n",
