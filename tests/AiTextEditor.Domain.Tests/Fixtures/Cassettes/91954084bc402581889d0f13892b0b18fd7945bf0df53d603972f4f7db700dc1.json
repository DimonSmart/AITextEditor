The user is asking for the second mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the book, excluding headers. The previous tool response gave an excerpt where Professor Zvezdokhin is mentioned as the one who proposed the discussion of Znaykina's book. The tool's summary says this is the second mention. But wait, the user wants the second occurrence, so I need to check if there's another mention after this. The tool response indicates the next pointer is at 35:1.1.1.p32, so maybe there's another mention later. However, the current evidence only shows one mention. Maybe the tool's response is the first occurrence, and the user is looking for the second. I should call the cursor agent again to find the next occurrence. Let me check the parameters. The startAfterPointer should be set to the pointer from the previous response, which is 25:1.1.1.p22. Wait, the tool response says the nextAfterPointer is 35:1.1.1.p32. So perhaps the second mention is at that pointer. I need to run the cursor agent again with the task to find the second mention, starting after the previous pointer. Let me structure the next tool call accordingly.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_910dales\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"CursorAgentPlugin-run_cursor_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"context\\\":\\\"Найти второе упоминание профессора Звёздочкина (исключая заголовки)\\\",\\\"startAfterPointer\\\":\\\"35:1.1.1.p32\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Найти второе упоминание профессора Звёздочкина (исключая заголовки)\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":671,\"completion_tokens\":367,\"total_tokens\":1038}}\n",
