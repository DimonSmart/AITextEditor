The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided the first batch of items. Let me check each item's markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item in the batch, the markdown is about everyone being happy, Ponchik being the one who suffered, and his actions with the costumes. There's no mention of Professor Zvezdokhin here. The pointer is 6:1.1.1.p3. Since the context is null and the firstBatch is false, but hasMore is true, there are more batches to come. The evidenceCount is 0, so no previous evidence. Since the current batch doesn't have any mention, I should continue scanning. The decision should be 'continue' because the first occurrence might be in a later batch. No new evidence to add here. So the JSON will have decision 'continue' and empty newEvidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":722,\"completion_tokens\":212,\"total_tokens\":934}}\n",
