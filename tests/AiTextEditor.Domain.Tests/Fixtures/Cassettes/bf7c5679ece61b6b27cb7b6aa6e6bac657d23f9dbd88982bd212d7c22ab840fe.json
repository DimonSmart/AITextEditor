The user is asking for the fourth mention of Professor Zvezdochkin in the book, excluding headers. So first, I need to make sure I'm tracking each occurrence correctly.\\n\\nStarting from the beginning, the first mention was in paragraph 21 when he reacts to Znayka's book. Then paragraph 22 mentions him again as he proposes the discussion. Paragraph 23 has him introducing the discussion. Wait, that's three mentions so far. \\n\\nNext, in paragraph 25, he's giving his report, so that's the fourth mention. Let me check the SemanticPointers again. The first occurrence was 24:1.1.1.p21, then 25:1.1.1.p22, 26:1.1.1.p23, and then 28:1.1.1.p25. So the fourth one is at 28:1.1.1.p25. \\n\\nWait, but the user wants the fourth mention, so counting each time his name appears. Let me verify each paragraph:\\n\\n1. p21: First mention.\\n2. p22: Second.\\n3. p23: Third.\\n4. p25: Fourth. \\n\\nYes, that's correct. The answer should be the paragraph with SemanticPointer 28:1.1.1.p25. The stop reason is goal_reached because we found the fourth mention.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_oxcgo6ep\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":3118,\"completion_tokens\":340,\"total_tokens\":3458}}\n",
