The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided a batch of text which is a paragraph from what seems like a story or educational text about the Moon's craters.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan the given paragraph for any mention of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" (Professor Zvezdokhin). The paragraph talks about Znayka returning to the Flower City and telling stories, especially interesting the astronomer Steklyashkin. It mentions Steklyashkin observing the Moon, discussing lunar craters, but there's no mention of Professor Zvezdokhin here. \\n\\nThe snapshot shows that evidenceCount is 0, and the afterPointer is 9:1.1.1.p6, which might indicate the current position in the text. Since the first batch isn't the last, there might be more batches to come. However, the current batch doesn't have any mention of the professor. The decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because even though this batch doesn't have the evidence, there could be future batches that do. The user hasn't provided any other batches yet, so we can't confirm if this is the first occurrence or not. Therefore, the correct decision here is to continue scanning further batches.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":783,\"completion_tokens\":291,\"total_tokens\":1074}}\n",
