The user is asking which paragraph in the document compares the lunar surface to a well-cooked blini and explains the bubbles of steam. \\n\\nFirst, I need to create a keyword cursor to find the relevant sections. The keywords provided are \\\"лунная поверхность\\\" (lunar surface), \\\"хорошо пропечённым блином\\\" (well-cooked blini), and \\\"пузырьки пара\\\" (steam bubbles). Using these keywords should help locate the specific paragraph.\\n\\nI'll start by calling the cursor-create_keyword_cursor function with these keywords. The includeHeadings parameter is set to true to ensure headings are included. Then, I'll read the cursor batches to find the matching paragraph. \\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, I'll use cursor-read_cursor_batch to get the items. Each batch will be checked for the keywords. The goal is to find the paragraph that contains all these elements. If the keywords are in the same paragraph, that's the answer. If not, I might need to check each keyword's context. \\n\\nI should also be careful to check if the paragraph mentions both the comparison to blini and the explanation of steam bubbles. Sometimes, the keywords might be in separate paragraphs, so I need to ensure they're in the same one. If the first batch doesn't have it, I'll continue reading until the relevant paragraph is found. \\n\\nFinally, once the correct paragraph is identified, I'll finalize the answer with the pointer and stop reason.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_1aqfyesu\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1261,\"completion_tokens\":342,\"total_tokens\":1603}}\n",
