The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with two character names followed by dialogue. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items. The first item (pointer 24:1.1.1.p21) is a paragraph discussing Professor Zvezdochkin's reaction to Znayka's book. There's no dialogue here, just narration. The second item (25:1.1.1.p22) mentions the professor proposing a discussion and Znayka attending. Still no dialogue. The third item (26:1.1.1.p23) starts with the professor entering and his first words. Wait, the paragraph says \\\"первое, что от него услышали, были слова:\\\" which translates to \\\"The first thing they heard from him were words:\\\" but there's no actual dialogue here yet. \\n\\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The task says \\\"Lines with two character names followed by dialogue.\\\" So the dialogue should have both names. Let me check again. The first paragraph mentions Znayka's book and Professor Zvezdochkin's reaction, but no direct dialogue. The second paragraph talks about the discussion starting with the professor's report. The third paragraph starts with the professor entering and his words, but again, no dialogue between two characters. \\n\\nHmm, maybe there's no dialogue in the provided batch. The user's snapshot has evidenceCount 0, and the task is to find the first dialog. Since there's no dialogue in the current batch items, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". But wait, maybe I missed a part. Let me check each paragraph again. \\n\\nFirst paragraph: No dialogue. Second: \\\"Знайка приехал, и обсуждение состоялось.\\\" No dialogue. Third: \\\"первое, что от него услышали, были слова:\\\" but no actual dialogue lines. So there's no evidence here. Therefore, the answer is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1132,\"completion_tokens\":447,\"total_tokens\":1579}}\n",
