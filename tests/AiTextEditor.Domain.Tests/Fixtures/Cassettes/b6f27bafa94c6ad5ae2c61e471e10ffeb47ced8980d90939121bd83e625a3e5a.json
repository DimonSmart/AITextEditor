I need to find the answer in the provided markdown document. Let me start by creating a keyword cursor to search for the word \\\"Пончик\\\". Since the user wants the first mention, I should use the cursor-create_keyword_cursor function with the keyword \\\"пончик\\\". \\n\\nWait, the function requires lowercase word stems to cover inflected forms. So I should use \\\"пончик\\\" as the keyword. Let me check the parameters again. The function takes an array of keywords, so I'll input [\\\"пончик\\\"].\\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, I'll read batches from it using cursor-read_cursor_batch. Each batch will give me paragraphs that mention Ponchik. Since I need the first occurrence, I'll stop once I find the earliest mention. \\n\\nI should also make sure to include headings in case the mention is in a heading. The includeHeadings parameter is set to true by default, so that's covered. \\n\\nAfter retrieving the batches, I'll look through the text to find the first instance where Ponchik is mentioned. The answer will be the location (page, section, etc.) where that first mention occurs. If the document is structured with sections, the pointer will indicate the exact spot. \\n\\nI need to be careful to read each batch and check each paragraph. If the first mention is in the first batch, that's the answer. If not, continue until the relevant batch is found. Once found, finalize the answer with the pointer and the stop reason.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_zzx4nj67\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"includeHeadings\\\":true,\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"пончик\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1111,\"completion_tokens\":349,\"total_tokens\":1460}}\n",
