The goal is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to check for any references to Professor Zvezdokhin. The user mentioned that the context is mentions excluding headers, so I should focus on paragraphs and list items, not headings.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer 8:1.1.1.p5, the markdown text talks about Znayka and his trip to the Sun City, meeting scientists like Fuxiya and Selodka. But there's no mention of Professor Zvezdokhin here. The next item, 9:1.1.1.p6, discusses Znayka's return and his stories, mentioning astronomer Steklyashkin. Still no Zvezdokhin. \\n\\nMoving to pointer 10:1.1.1.p7, the text talks about scientists in Sun City arguing about the origin of lunar craters, splitting into two groups. Again, no mention of the professor. The last item, 11:1.1.1.p8, describes Znayka's own theory about lunar craters, observing the Moon with Steklyashkin. Still no sign of Professor Zvezdokhin. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each paragraph again. The first batch's items don't have any mention of Professor Zvezdokhin. All the references are to Znayka, Fuxiya, Selodka, and Steklyashkin. Since the task is to find the first mention, and none of the current batch items mention Professor Zvezdokhin, the decision should be 'not_found'. The evidenceCount from the snapshot is 0, and the recentEvidencePointers are empty, so there's no prior evidence. Therefore, the correct output is to indicate that no new evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1679,\"completion_tokens\":421,\"total_tokens\":2100}}\n",
