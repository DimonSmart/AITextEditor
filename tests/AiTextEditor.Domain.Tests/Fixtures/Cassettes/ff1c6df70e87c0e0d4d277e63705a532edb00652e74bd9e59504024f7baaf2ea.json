Однако, при попытке создания целей с этим указателем возникла ошибка, что может означать неправильный формат или отсутствие такого указателя в документе. Проверьте корректность указателя или обратитесь к содержанию книги для уточнения расположения упоминания. \\n\\n**Семантический указатель:** `70:1.1.1.p67`\",\"reasoning\":\"Okay, let's try to figure out why the user is getting an error when trying to create targets with the pointer \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\". The user asked for the second mention of Professor Zvezdokhin, excluding headers. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check if the pointer \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\" actually exists in the document. The previous tool response mentioned that the cursor found three pointers, but the second one was at \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\". However, when trying to create targets with that pointer, it's not found. Maybe there's a mistake in the pointer format or the pointer doesn't exist.\\n\\nWait, the user might have a typo in the pointer. Let me check the original tool response again. The first mention was at \\\"24:1.1.1.p21\\\", the second at \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\", and the third at \\\"79:1.1.1.p76\\\". The error suggests that \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\" isn't found. Maybe the document's pointers are structured differently. Perhaps the format is incorrect, like the segment or paragraph numbers being wrong.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the document doesn't have a pointer at that exact location. The user might have intended to use a different pointer. Let me verify if the second mention was correctly identified. The second excerpt was from \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\", but if that pointer doesn't exist, the function can't create targets there. \\n\\nAnother possibility is that the pointer format in the tool's response is different. For example, maybe the correct format is \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\" but the system expects \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\" with a different separator. Or maybe the pointer is stored as \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\" but the tool expects \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\" without the colon. \\n\\nWait, looking at the initial tool response, the pointers are given as \\\"24:1.1.1.p21\\\", \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\", and \\\"79:1.1.1.p76\\\". The format seems to be \\\"segment:chapter.paragraph.pnumber\\\". So \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\" would be segment 70, chapter 1.1.1, paragraph 67. But if the actual document's pointers are different, maybe the system can't find it. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the pointer's segment number. For example, if the correct segment is 70, but the actual document's segment is different. Without access to the document's actual pointers, it's hard to tell. \\n\\nSince the user is getting an error, the best approach is to check if the pointer exists. If not, perhaps the second mention was actually the third pointer, or there's a different pointer. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different method to retrieve the correct pointer. \\n\\nIn any case, the error indicates that the pointer \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\" isn't found. The user might need to verify the pointer's correctness or check if there's another way to reference the second mention. Since the system can't access the document's internal structure, it's possible that the pointer was incorrectly recorded. \\n\\nTherefore, the correct step is to inform the user that the pointer doesn't exist and suggest verifying the pointer's format or checking for alternative references. However, since the user's original question was about the second mention, and the tool response indicated that the second mention was at \\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\", but that pointer isn't found, there might be an inconsistency. \\n\\nIn conclusion, the error is due to the pointer not being found, so the user should be informed that the pointer is invalid and that the second mention might be referenced by a different pointer.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":6049,\"completion_tokens\":1005,\"total_tokens\":7054}}\n",
