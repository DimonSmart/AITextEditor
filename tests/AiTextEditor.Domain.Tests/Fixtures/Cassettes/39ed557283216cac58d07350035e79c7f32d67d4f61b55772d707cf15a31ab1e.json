The user is asking to find a paragraph where Ponchik chooses a darker night and drowns his old clothes in the Ogurcovka River. First, I need to check the current batch's items for any mention of Ponchik, a dark night, and the Ogurcovka River.\\n\\nLooking through the provided paragraphs, the pointers range from 36:1.1.1.p33 to 57:1.1.1.p54. The content here discusses topics like the Moon's composition, cooling processes, and a debate between characters Znayka and Zvezdochkin. There's mention of a river in the context of the Moon's formation, but that's in the paragraph about the Moon's internal cavity. However, the task involves Ponchik, which isn't mentioned here. \\n\\nWait, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", which was from a previous batch. The current batch doesn't have any references to Ponchik or the Ogurcovka River. All the paragraphs here are about scientific discussions, not the story involving Ponchik. Therefore, there's no relevant evidence in the current batch. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the required elements aren't present here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2381,\"completion_tokens\":288,\"total_tokens\":2669}}\n",
