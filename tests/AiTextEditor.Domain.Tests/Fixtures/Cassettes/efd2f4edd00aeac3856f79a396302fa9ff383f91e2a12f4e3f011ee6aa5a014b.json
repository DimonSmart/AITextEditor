Let me figure out how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search for mentions of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\". The function mcp-create_cursor seems right for this. I'll name the cursor something like \\\"search_cursor\\\" and describe it as finding mentions of Professor Zvezdokhin. \\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, I should run the agent to iterate through the document. Using mcp-run_agent with the cursor name. Each time the agent runs, it will return the next portion of the document. I need to check each result to see if it's a mention of the professor. \\n\\nSince the user wants the second occurrence, I'll have to keep track of how many times the name appears. The first match is the first mention, the second one is what the user needs. I should stop once I find the second occurrence and return the paragraph along with the semantic pointer. \\n\\nI also need to make sure not to include any headers. So when checking the results, I'll skip any headings and only consider the actual text content. If the cursor runs out of results before finding the second mention, I should inform the user that it's not found in the document.\\n\\nLet me start by creating the cursor. Then, run the agent and check each result sequentially.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_dn1tvsi7\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"description\\\":\\\"Find mentions of профессора Звёздочкина (excluding headers)\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":681,\"completion_tokens\":339,\"total_tokens\":1020}}\n",
