I need to find the earliest occurrence of his name in the text.\\n\\nFirst, I created a keyword cursor with the keywords \\\"профессор\\\" and \\\"звёздочкин\\\", making sure to exclude headings. The cursor should scan the document for any paragraphs containing either keyword. \\n\\nNow, I need to read the batches from this cursor to find the first mention. I'll start by reading the first batch. If the mention is there, I'll note the pointer. If not, I'll continue to the next batches until I find it or exhaust the document. Since the user wants the first occurrence, I have to check each batch in order and stop at the earliest one. Let's read the first batch now.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_z3myjcz0\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"chat_cursor_tools-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1222,\"completion_tokens\":200,\"total_tokens\":1422}}\n",
