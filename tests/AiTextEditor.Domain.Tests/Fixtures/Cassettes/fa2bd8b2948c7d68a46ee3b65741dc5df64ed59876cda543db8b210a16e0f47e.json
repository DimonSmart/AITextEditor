The user wants to find out why everyone ran away from Ponchik because of naphthalene, and the hosts were opening windows and doors. The task is to find evidence from the current batch that explains this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check the current batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, but the user is asking for more. The recentEvidencePointers include \\\"7:1.1.1.p4\\\", which I should avoid since the rules say not to include pointers from the snapshot.\\n\\nLooking through the batch items, most of them are paragraphs from a story involving Znayka and his experiences on the Moon. There's mention of weightlessness, objects floating, and a rock from the Moon. However, none of these paragraphs mention naphthalene, Ponchik, or people running away. The story seems to be about a space adventure, not related to the initial task.\\n\\nSince the current batch doesn't have any content related to naphthalene, Ponchik, or the hosts opening windows and doors, there's no evidence to extract. The user might be referring to a different context or batch that's not provided here. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required evidence isn't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2223,\"completion_tokens\":285,\"total_tokens\":2508}}\n",
