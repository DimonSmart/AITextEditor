The user wants to find the second mention of Professor Zvezdokhin, excluding headers. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so we start fresh.\\n\\nLooking at the batch items, the first mention is in the heading \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\" (pointer 3:1.1.1). But the task says to exclude headers, so that's not counted. Now, I need to scan the paragraphs for the second mention.\\n\\nLooking through the paragraphs (pointers 4:1.1.1.p1 to 7:1.1.1.p4), the first mention in the text is in paragraph 4:1.1.1.p1, where it says \\\"прошло два с половиной года. Хотя для нас с вами это не так уж много, но для маленьких коротышек два с половиной года – срок очень большой. Наслушавшись рассказов Незнайки, Кнопочки и Пачкули Пёстренького, многие коротышки тоже совершили поездку в Солнечный город, а когда возвратились, решили и у себя сделать кое-какие усовершенствования.\\\" Wait, that's the first mention? Wait, no. Wait, the heading mentions Professor Zvezdokhin, but the task says to exclude headers. So the first mention in the text is in paragraph 4:1.1.1.p1? Wait, no. Wait, the heading is the first mention, but since headers are excluded, the actual mention in the text might be elsewhere. Wait, maybe I need to check each paragraph for the name \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" again. Wait, the heading is \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\", which is a heading, so excluded. Then, looking through the paragraphs, does any of them mention Professor Zvezdokhin again? Let me check each paragraph:\\n\\nParagraph 4:1.1.1.p1: Talks about Незнайка's trip, but no mention of the professor.\\n\\nParagraph 5:1.1.1.p2: Mentions the professor? No, it's about the factory.\\n\\nParagraph 6:1.1.1.p3: Pончик's story, no mention.\\n\\nParagraph 7:1.1.1.p4: Still about Pончик and the moth, no mention.\\n\\nWait, so maybe there's no second mention in this batch? But the task says to find the second mention. Wait, maybe the first mention is in the heading (excluded), and the second is in the text. But in the given batch, after the heading, the paragraphs don't mention the professor again. So perhaps there's no second mention here. But the user's task says to find it, so maybe there's an error. Alternatively, maybe the first mention is in the heading (excluded), and the second is in the text. But in the provided batch, there's no other mention. Therefore, the answer would be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no second mention in the current batch. Wait, but the user might have more batches. However, the input says \\\"firstBatch\\\":true and \\\"hasMoreBatches\\\":true, so there might be more batches. But the current batch doesn't have the second mention. So the decision would be \\\"continue\\\" because there's no evidence here, but the user might have more batches. Wait, but according to the rules, we can only use the current batch. Since there's no second mention in the current batch, the answer is \\\"not_found\\\" or \\\"continue\\\"? Wait, the decision options are \\\"continue\\\", \\\"done\\\", or \\\"not_found\\\". If there's no evidence in the current batch, then \\\"not_found\\\" would be appropriate. But maybe the user expects that the second mention is in the next batch. However, the current batch doesn't have it. So the correct decision here is \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no second mention in the current batch. Therefore, the output should be \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1889,\"completion_tokens\":911,\"total_tokens\":2800}}\n",
