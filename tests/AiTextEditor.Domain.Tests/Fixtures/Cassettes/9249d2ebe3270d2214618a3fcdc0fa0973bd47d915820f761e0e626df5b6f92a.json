The user is looking for a description of two rotating buildings on Kolokolchikov Street with a spiral descent and a devil's wheel on the roof. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, pointer 4:1.1.1.p1, but that's from a previous batch. The current batch has items 8 to 11, which are paragraphs from a story about Znayka's trip to the Moon.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check each paragraph in the current batch for any mentions of rotating buildings, spiral descents, or a devil's wheel. Let me go through each one:\\n\\nParagraph 8 (8:1.1.1.p5) talks about Znayka visiting the Sun City, meeting scientists, and a rocket trip to the Moon. There's no mention of buildings or the specific features the user is asking about.\\n\\nParagraph 9 (9:1.1.1.p6) discusses the Moon's surface, craters, and how they look. Still nothing about buildings or the required elements.\\n\\nParagraph 10 (10:1.1.1.p7) talks about the debate between volcanic and meteorite theories for craters. Not relevant here.\\n\\nParagraph 11 (11:1.1.1.p8) describes Znayka's observation of the Moon's surface resembling a pancake with bubbles. Again, no mention of buildings or the specific features.\\n\\nNone of the current paragraphs mention rotating buildings, spiral descents, or a devil's wheel. The existing evidence from the snapshot (pointer 4:1.1.1.p1) isn't in the current batch, so we can't use it. Since there's no new evidence in the current batch that matches the task, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1705,\"completion_tokens\":395,\"total_tokens\":2100}}\n",
