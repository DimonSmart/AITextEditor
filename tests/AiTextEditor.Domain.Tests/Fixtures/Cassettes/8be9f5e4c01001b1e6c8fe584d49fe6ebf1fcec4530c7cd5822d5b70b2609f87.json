The user asked to find the first dialogue between two named characters and name them. I called the CursorAgentPlugin with the task, but the response says \\\"decision_done\\\" without evidence. Maybe the agent didn't find anything. Since the tool didn't return any evidence, I should check if the document doesn't have such a dialogue. But wait, maybe the cursor is pointing to a specific location. The nextAfterPointer is \\\"35:1.1.1.p32\\\". Perhaps I need to start searching from there. Let me try running the cursor agent again, starting after that pointer, to see if there's a dialogue mentioned. If not, then the answer is that it's not found in the document.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":472,\"completion_tokens\":181,\"total_tokens\":653}}\n",
