The user is asking in which paragraph Znayka compares the lunar surface to a well-cooked pancake and explains the bubbles of steam. First, I need to find the relevant part of the document.\\n\\nI remember that the user previously used a cursor to search for mentions involving \\\"лунная поверхность\\\" (lunar surface), \\\"блины\\\" (pancakes), and \\\"пузырьки пара\\\" (steam bubbles). The cursor was named \\\"search_cursor\\\". Now, the response from the tool indicates that there are no more items to process, and the cursor is complete. \\n\\nWait, but the user is asking for a specific comparison. Maybe the initial search didn't find the exact paragraph. Let me check again. The user might need to look for the exact mention where Znayka makes this comparison. Since the cursor didn't find any items, perhaps the filter was too strict. Maybe I should adjust the filter to look for the exact phrases. Alternatively, maybe the paragraph contains the keywords but in a different context. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the first mention is in the first item, but the cursor didn't return it. Let me try creating a new cursor with a slightly different filter, perhaps focusing on \\\"лунная поверхность\\\" and \\\"блины\\\" together, and then run the agent to find the first occurrence. If the cursor returns an item, I can check the evidence. If not, then the document might not have that information. \\n\\nWait, the user's previous attempt with the cursor didn't find any items. So maybe the answer isn't in the document. But the user is asking specifically, so I should confirm. Alternatively, maybe the paragraph is in a different part of the document. Let me try another approach. Maybe the filter should include \\\"сравнивает\\\" (compares) and \\\"объясняет\\\" (explains) to narrow it down. Let me adjust the filter and run the cursor again.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_y09v0lnv\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"contains 'сравнивает лунную поверхность с хорошо пропечённым блином' and 'объясняет пузырьки пара'\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor_v2\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1153,\"completion_tokens\":486,\"total_tokens\":1639}}\n",
