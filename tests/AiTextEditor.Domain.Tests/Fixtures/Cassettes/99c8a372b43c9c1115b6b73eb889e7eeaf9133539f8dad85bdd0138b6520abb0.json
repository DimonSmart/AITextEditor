The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided the first batch of items. Let me look through the items.\\n\\nThe only item in the first batch is a paragraph with pointer \\\"22:1.1.1.p19\\\". The markdown content talks about Znayka pondering and realizing the walls were made by intelligent beings. It mentions lunar inhabitants called \\\"лунные коротышки\\\" or \\\"лунатики\\\", and their cities with walls and glass domes. However, there's no mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" here. The text discusses Znayka's book about the moon inhabitants but doesn't reference Professor Zvezdokhin. \\n\\nSince the task is to find the first occurrence, and this batch doesn't have it, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there might be more batches. The evidence count is zero, so the snapshot's evidenceCount is correct. The user hasn't found any matches yet, so the answer should indicate that the scan continues.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":702,\"completion_tokens\":247,\"total_tokens\":949}}\n",
