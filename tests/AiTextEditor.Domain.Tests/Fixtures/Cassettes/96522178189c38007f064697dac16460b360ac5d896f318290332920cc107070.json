The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context specifies that lines must have at least two named characters in a dialogue format. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items:\\n\\n1. The first item is a paragraph starting with \\\"– Для чего понадобилась ещё эта блинистая теория...\\\" It's a single paragraph, but it doesn't seem like a dialogue. It's more of a question from one character, maybe the narrator or a character named \\\"Для чего\\\" (which doesn't make sense, maybe a mistranslation). Wait, maybe the first part is a dialogue? The dash might indicate a speaker, but there's no second character mentioned here.\\n\\n2. The second item is a paragraph where \\\"Знайка\\\" (a character name) is responding. The paragraph starts with \\\"Знайка отвечал...\\\" which is a dialogue line, but it's only one character speaking. The task requires two named characters in a dialogue. So this is a monologue, not a dialogue.\\n\\n3. The third item is \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which again is a single character (Метеоритчики, possibly a group or a character name) speaking. No second character mentioned here.\\n\\nNone of the items in the current batch have two named characters in a dialogue. The first item might be a dialogue line from one character, but there's no second character. The other items are monologues. Therefore, there's no evidence here that meets the task's criteria. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since no valid dialogue between two named characters is present.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":794,\"completion_tokens\":375,\"total_tokens\":1169}}\n",
