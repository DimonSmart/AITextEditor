The user is asking about Фуксия and Селедочка, specifically who they are and where they are first mentioned. First, I need to figure out how to find their first mentions in the document.\\n\\nThe user mentioned using a cursor to search for these names. The previous assistant created a cursor named \\\"search_cursor\\\" with a filter to find paragraphs containing either name. Now, the response from the tool indicates that the cursor was created successfully. \\n\\nNext, I should run the agent using this cursor to scan through the document. The agent will process each portion of the document that matches the filter. Since the user wants the first mentions, I need to make sure the agent stops after finding the first occurrences. \\n\\nWait, the agent's parameters include maxEvidenceCount, which defaults to -1 (unlimited). But since we're looking for the first mentions, maybe setting maxEvidenceCount to 1 would suffice. However, the user might want both names checked, so perhaps process each separately. But the initial cursor filter already includes both names. \\n\\nI should call agent-run_agent with the cursor name and a task description to find the first mentions. The agent will return the relevant paragraphs. If the first mention is found, I can extract the information. If not, continue scanning until the cursor completes or no more items are available. \\n\\nAlso, need to check if the initial cursor's filter is correct. The filter is \\\"paragraph contains 'Фуксия' or 'Селедочка'\\\". This should capture any paragraph where either name appears. Then, the agent will process each matching paragraph, and the first occurrence of each name would be the answer. \\n\\nWait, but the user is asking for both characters. So, the first mention of Фуксия and the first mention of Селедочка. The cursor might find paragraphs where either is mentioned, so I need to check each paragraph to see which name is first. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the first occurrence of either name in the document is the answer. But the user might want both. So, the agent should process all matching paragraphs and then determine the first mentions. \\n\\nI'll proceed by running the agent with the cursor, and then analyze the results to find the first mentions of each character. If the agent returns the paragraphs, I can then parse them to answer the question.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_8acius5l\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find first mentions of Фуксия and Селедочка\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1018,\"completion_tokens\":530,\"total_tokens\":1548}}\n",
