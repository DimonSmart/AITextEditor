The user wants to find the first direct dialogue with two named characters in the same sentence. The context mentions examples like 'Alice says to Bob: Hello' or 'John: Hi, Mary!'. So, I need to look for direct speech where two named characters are mentioned in the same sentence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, the items have pointers, itemType, and markdown. The first item is a heading with \\\"## Глава первая\\\". Since the itemType is Heading, and the markdown is just the heading text, there's no dialogue here. The task specifies to scan only the current batch, and this batch only has a heading. \\n\\nThe snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty. Since there are no items with itemType as Paragraph or ListItem, there's no content to check for dialogue. The user's instruction says to output exactly one JSON object. Since there's no evidence found, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The newEvidence array will be empty. I need to make sure not to include any pointers from recentEvidencePointers because they aren't in this batch. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 1, but since there's no relevant content, the decision remains \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":638,\"completion_tokens\":273,\"total_tokens\":911}}\n",
