The user wants the first dialogue between two named characters. The task says to find the first occurrence in the current batch. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so we need to look through the items provided.\\n\\nLooking at the batch items, there are three headings. The first is a main heading, then a chapter heading, and then a section heading. None of these seem to contain dialogue. The context mentions lines with character names followed by dialogue markers, but the items here are all headings. Since there's no actual dialogue content in the provided batch, there's no evidence to extract. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required dialogue isn't present here. Also, since there are no pointers from the recent evidence, we can't add anything. So the output is \\\"not_found\\\" with empty newEvidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":665,\"completion_tokens\":189,\"total_tokens\":854}}\n",
