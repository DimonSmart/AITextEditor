The user wants the first mention of Professor Zvezdochkin being described as \\\"кипевший от негодования\\\" (boiling with indignation) and a brief description of his character. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, but the pointer given is \\\"24:1.1.1.p21\\\", which isn't in the current batch. The current batch starts from pointer \\\"36:1.1.1.p33\\\" onwards. So, I need to check each item in this batch for the keyword \\\"кипевший от негодования\\\".\\n\\nLooking at each paragraph:\\n\\n- The first item (p33) has Znayka speaking, but no mention of Zvezdochkin's emotion.\\n- p34: Zvezdochkin interjects, but the emotion here is more like a question, not indignation.\\n- p35: The audience laughs, but Zvezdochkin isn't described here.\\n- p36: Znayka explains about the Moon's cooling. No emotion here.\\n- p37: A listener exclaims, but not Zvezdochkin.\\n- p38: Znayka continues, but again, no emotion.\\n- p39: Zvezdochkin smiles, which is a reaction but not the required description.\\n- p40: The professor (Zvezdochkin) responds serdito (seriously), but not \\\"кипевший\\\".\\n- p41: Here, the professor says \\\"сердито буркнул\\\" which translates to \\\"muttered angrily\\\". That's close but not exactly \\\"кипевший от негодования\\\".\\n- p42: Znayka explains, but no emotion.\\n- p43: Someone else reacts, not Zvezdochkin.\\n- p44: The professor is mentioned again, but the emotion here is anger, but the exact phrase isn't there.\\n- p45: Crowd cheers, but no description of Zvezdochkin's state.\\n- p46: Another cheer, no info.\\n- p47: Zvezdochkin is being dragged, but no emotional description.\\n- p48: Crowd demands, but no mention of his emotion.\\n- p49: Znayka is on the tribune, but not Zvezdochkin.\\n- p50: Crowd asks about the Moon, no emotion.\\n- p51: Znayka talks about weightlessness, no emotion.\\n- p52: Someone asks about feelings, but no description of Zvezdochkin.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The key phrase is \\\"кипевший от негодования\\\", which is \\\"boiling with indignation\\\". The closest is in p41 where the professor says \\\"сердито буркнул\\\" (muttered angrily). But that's not the exact phrase. The user might be looking for that, but the task specifies the exact description. Since none of the current batch items have the exact phrase, but the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"24:1.1.1.p21\\\", which isn't in this batch. The user might have moved on to the next batch, but the current batch doesn't have the required evidence. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the current batch doesn't contain the required mention. However, the user might have intended that the previous batch had it, but since the current batch doesn't, the answer is not found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2391,\"completion_tokens\":787,\"total_tokens\":3178}}\n",
