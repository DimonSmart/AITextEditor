The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. The context mentions paragraphs with named characters in dialogue format. The user provided a batch of three paragraphs.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan each item in the batch for dialogues. Let's look at each paragraph one by one.\\n\\nStarting with the first paragraph (pointer 24:1.1.1.p21). The text talks about Professor Zvezdochkin being angry about the book, but there's no direct dialogue here. It's more of a narrative description.\\n\\nNext, the second paragraph (25:1.1.1.p22). It mentions the professor proposing a discussion and the academy agreeing. Still, there's no dialogue between two named characters here. It's setting up the event but not actual conversation.\\n\\nThird paragraph (26:1.1.1.p23). The text says when everyone gathered, the professor came up and his first words were... Wait, the paragraph starts with \\\"Когда все приглашённые на обсуждение коротышки собрались в просторном зале и расселись на стулья, на трибуну взошёл профессор Звёздочкин, и первое, что от него услышали, были слова:\\\" So the professor is about to speak, but the actual dialogue hasn't started yet. The paragraph ends with his words, but the exact dialogue isn't present here. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first paragraph mentions the professor's reaction, but no dialogue. The second paragraph talks about the discussion starting with his report. The third paragraph is the setup for the discussion. There's no actual dialogue between two named characters in any of these paragraphs. The professor is speaking, but there's no other character's dialogue mentioned yet. \\n\\nHmm, maybe the first dialogue is in the next batch? But the user only provided the first batch. Since the task says \\\"first dialogue between two named characters,\\\" and in the given batch, there's no such dialogue. So the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no evidence in the current batch. But wait, the user's snapshot has evidenceCount 0, and the task's maxEvidenceCount is null, so maybe we need to continue. However, according to the rules, if there's no evidence, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\". But the user might expect that the first dialogue is in the next batch. But since the current batch has no dialogues between two named characters, the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1125,\"completion_tokens\":562,\"total_tokens\":1687}}\n",
