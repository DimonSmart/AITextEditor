The task is to find a description where astronomers in the Solar City argued and split into volcanists and meteoritists. First, I need to scan the current batch items for any mentions of such a split. The user mentioned that the evidence pointers from previous batches are in the snapshot, so I should avoid those.\\n\\nLooking at the batch items, the pointers start from 23:1.1.1.p20 onwards. Let me check each paragraph. \\n\\nThe first item (23:1.1.1.p20) talks about lunatics moving inside the Moon, but no mention of astronomers arguing. The next ones (24:1.1.1.p21) mention Professor Zvezdochkin criticizing Znayka's book, but that's about a book discussion, not a split into groups. \\n\\nItem 25:1.1.1.p22 mentions the academy proposing a discussion, but again, no split. Items 26-28 describe the discussion setup, but no conflict yet. \\n\\nItem 28:1.1.1.p25 has the professor starting his speech, but still no split. Then item 29:1.1.1.p26 is Znayka responding, and they start arguing. However, the argument here is between Znayka and the professor about the Moon's gravity, not about splitting into volcanists and meteoritists. \\n\\nLooking further, item 34:1.1.1.p31 talks about Znayka's experiment with water in a bottle, and the professor is skeptical. But again, no mention of the two groups. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. The task mentions \\\"astronomers in the Solar City\\\" splitting into volcanists and meteoritists. None of the paragraphs mention Solar City or the split into those specific groups. The arguments are about the Moon's structure and gravity, not about different schools of thought like volcanists vs. meteoritists. \\n\\nSince none of the current batch items mention the required split, the decision should be 'not_found'. The newEvidence array would be empty. So the output is 'not_found' with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2273,\"completion_tokens\":478,\"total_tokens\":2751}}\n",
