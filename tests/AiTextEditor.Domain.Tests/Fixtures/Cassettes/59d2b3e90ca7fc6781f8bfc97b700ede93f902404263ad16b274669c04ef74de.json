The user wants the first mention of Ponchik throwing old costumes into the Ogurcovna River. The context is paragraphs mentioning both Ponchik and the river. The snapshot shows one evidence pointer already, but it's from a previous batch. The current batch has three items.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check each item's markdown for mentions of Ponchik and Ogurcovna River. Let's look at each paragraph:\\n\\n1. The first paragraph mentions \\\"понадобилась ещё эта блинистая теория\\\" but doesn't have Ponchik or the river. So no match here.\\n\\n2. The second paragraph talks about volcanoes and lunar craters but again, no Ponchik or Ogurcovna River. So no match.\\n\\n3. The third paragraph starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which translates to \\\"Meteorites said:\\\" but there's no mention of Ponchik or the river here either. \\n\\nNone of the current batch items mention Ponchik and Ogurcovna River together. The snapshot's recent evidence pointer is from a different batch, so maybe the first mention is in a previous batch. But since the user is providing the current batch, and none of these items match, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no new evidence in the current batch. The existing evidence from the snapshot might be from a previous batch, but the current batch doesn't have any new matches. So the answer is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":813,\"completion_tokens\":333,\"total_tokens\":1146}}\n",
