The user wants me to find the first direct dialogue between two named characters. The task specifies that the evidence should be a paragraph with direct dialogue, like \\\"Alice: Hello, Bob.\\\" and focus on named entities in a conversational context. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once I find one, I should set the decision to \\\"done\\\".\\n\\nLooking at the input, the snapshot has an evidenceCount of 0 and no recent pointers. The batch items include a heading with \\\"## Глава первая\\\" (which is Russian for \\\"Chapter One\\\"). But the user mentioned that headings shouldn't be considered unless the task asks for them. Since the task is about dialogue between characters, the heading here doesn't contain any dialogue. \\n\\nThe batch only has one item, which is a heading. There's no markdown content that includes a direct dialogue. Therefore, there's no evidence to extract. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there are no matching items in the current batch. Also, since the evidenceCount is 0 and the batch doesn't provide any relevant content, the newEvidence array will be empty. So the final output should indicate that no evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":625,\"completion_tokens\":261,\"total_tokens\":886}}\n",
