The user is asking which paragraph in the document where Знайка (Znayka) compares the lunar surface to a well-cooked blini and explains the bubbles of steam. \\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out the right approach. The user wants a specific paragraph, so I should use the keyword search function. The keywords here are \\\"лунная поверхность\\\" (lunar surface), \\\"блином\\\" (blini), and \\\"пузырьки пара\\\" (steam bubbles). Since the user mentioned \\\"хорошо пропечённым блином\\\" (well-cooked blini), I should include that exact phrase or its stems.\\n\\nWait, the tools mention using cursor-create_keyword_cursor for keyword searches. The function requires an array of keywords. Let me break down the keywords. The main terms are \\\"лунная поверхность\\\", \\\"хорошо пропечённым блином\\\", and \\\"пузырьки пара\\\". But maybe using stems would be better to catch variations. For example, \\\"лунная\\\" could be \\\"лунный\\\", \\\"блином\\\" might be \\\"блины\\\", and \\\"пузырьки\\\" could be \\\"пузырь\\\". However, the user specified \\\"хорошо пропечённым блином\\\", which is a specific phrase. Maybe it's better to include that exact phrase as a keyword.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the stems might cover more instances. Let me think. If I use \\\"лунная\\\", \\\"блином\\\", and \\\"пузырьки\\\", that might capture the necessary terms. But the exact phrase \\\"хорошо пропечённым блином\\\" is crucial. Maybe I should include both the exact phrase and the stems. Wait, the function allows an array of keywords, so I can include both the exact phrase and the stems. However, the user might have a specific paragraph where all these elements are present. \\n\\nAnother consideration: the user is looking for a paragraph where Знайка makes the comparison and explains the steam bubbles. So the keywords should include the comparison and the explanation. Let me structure the keywords as [\\\"лунная поверхность\\\", \\\"блином\\\", \\\"пузырьки пара\\\"]. That should cover the main terms. \\n\\nWait, the function uses logical OR, so any paragraph containing any of the keywords will be matched. But the user needs a paragraph that contains all elements. However, the function might not handle AND conditions, only OR. So maybe I need to include all the necessary keywords to ensure the paragraph is found. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the exact phrase \\\"хорошо пропечённым блином\\\" is unique enough. Let me include that as a keyword. So the keywords array would be [\\\"лунная поверхность\\\", \\\"хорошо пропечённым блином\\\", \\\"пузырьки пара\\\"]. That should narrow it down. \\n\\nI should create a keyword cursor with these keywords. Then read the batches to find the matching paragraph. Once found, the answer will be the pointer to that paragraph. \\n\\nI need to make sure that the cursor is created correctly and then read the batches. The user might have multiple mentions, so I need to check each batch until the correct one is found. Also, the answer should mention the goal and the stop reason, like goal_reached.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_q2yuixdf\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"includeHeadings\\\":true,\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"лунная поверхность\\\",\\\"хорошо пропечённым блином\\\",\\\"пузырьки пара\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1192,\"completion_tokens\":765,\"total_tokens\":1957}}\n",
