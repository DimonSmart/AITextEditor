The user wants to find the second mention of Professor Zvezdochkin, excluding headers. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so we start fresh.\\n\\nLooking at the current batch's items, all are paragraphs. I need to scan each for any reference to Professor Zvezdochkin. Let's check each paragraph:\\n\\n1. The first paragraph mentions Znayka and other characters like Fuxiya and Selyodka, but no Zvezdochkin.\\n2. The second paragraph talks about Steklyashkin, an astronomer, but again, not Zvezdochkin.\\n3. The third paragraph discusses astronomers in the Solar City arguing about the origin of lunar craters. No mention of the professor here either.\\n4. The fourth paragraph mentions Znayka and Steklyashkin observing the Moon, but still no Zvezdochkin.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The task is about the second occurrence, so maybe there's a mention in one of these paragraphs that I overlooked. But looking through each excerpt again, there's no mention of Professor Zvezdochkin at all. The names present are Znayka, Fuxiya, Selyodka, and Steklyashkin. Since the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0 and the current batch doesn't have any references, the answer should be that there's no evidence found. However, the user's task might have a typo or maybe the professor's name is misspelled. But based on the given text, there's no mention. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there are no matches in the current batch and the evidenceCount remains 0.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2105,\"completion_tokens\":381,\"total_tokens\":2486}}\n",
