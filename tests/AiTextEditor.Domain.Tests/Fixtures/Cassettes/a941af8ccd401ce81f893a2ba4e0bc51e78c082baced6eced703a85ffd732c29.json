The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters and name them. I created a cursor to look for lines with at least two named characters in a dialogue format. Now, I need to run the agent to process this cursor.\\n\\nFirst, I'll call the agent-run_agent function with the cursor name \\\"dialogue_cursor\\\" and a task description to find the first occurrence. I'll set maxEvidenceCount to 1 to get the first mention. The agent should scan the document using the cursor and return the first dialogue that meets the criteria.\\n\\nWait, the cursor was created with a filter for lines with two named characters in dialogue format. The agent will process the next portion of the document. If the first evidence item has a dialogue between two characters, that's the answer. If not, I might need to check the next batch by calling run_agent again with the same cursor. But since the user asked for the first occurrence, stopping at the first evidence item should suffice. Let's see what the tool response gives.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_25k7fgro\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"dialogue_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first dialogue between two named characters\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1252,\"completion_tokens\":263,\"total_tokens\":1515}}\n",
