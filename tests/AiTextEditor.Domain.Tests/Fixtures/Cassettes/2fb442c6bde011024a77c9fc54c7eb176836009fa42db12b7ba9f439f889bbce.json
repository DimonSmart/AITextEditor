The user wants to find the first mentions of \\\"Фуксия\\\" and \\\"Селедочка\\\" in the provided batch. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so we need to look through the current batch items.\\n\\nFirst, I'll go through each item's markdown content. The first item (pointer 4:1.1.1.p1) talks about the Sun City and various buildings, but I don't see \\\"Фуксия\\\" or \\\"Селедочка\\\" here. The second item (pointer 5:1.1.1.p2) mentions a clothing factory and some machinery, but again, no trace of the required terms. \\n\\nSince neither of the paragraphs in the current batch contains either \\\"Фуксия\\\" or \\\"Селедочка\\\", there's no evidence to report. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the terms aren't present here. The user might need to check subsequent batches or confirm if the terms are indeed in the text. But based on the given data, there's nothing to add.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1267,\"completion_tokens\":248,\"total_tokens\":1515}}\n",
