The task is to check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different. Then return the names and the dialogue text.\\n\\nFirst, I need to look at the current batch items. The batch has three paragraphs. Let's check each one.\\n\\nFirst item: pointer \\\"60:1.1.1.p57\\\", markdown \\\"Некоторые от нетерпения даже застучали по полу ногами.\\\" This is a paragraph, but it doesn't start with a character's name followed by a colon. It's a general statement. So probably not relevant.\\n\\nSecond item: pointer \\\"61:1.1.1.p58\\\", markdown starts with \\\"– Ну так вот, – продолжал Знайка. – Убедившись, что всё в порядке...\\\" So here, the paragraph starts with a dash, then \\\"Ну так вот,\\\" followed by \\\"продолжал Знайка.\\\" Wait, the structure here is a bit different. The actual dialogue might be \\\"Ну так вот,\\\" but the speaker is indicated by \\\"продолжал Знайка.\\\" But the way it's written: the paragraph starts with a dash, then the quote, then \\\"продолжал Знайка.\\\" So maybe the speaker's name is mentioned after the quote. But the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So does this paragraph start with a name? Let's see: the markdown is \\\"– Ну так вот, – продолжал Знайка. – Убедившись...\\\" So the first part is a dash, then the quote, then \\\"продолжал Знайка.\\\" So the name \\\"Знайка\\\" comes after the quote, not at the start. So the paragraph doesn't start with the name followed by a colon. Instead, the name is part of the narrative. So maybe this isn't a direct quote starting with the name.\\n\\nThird item: pointer \\\"62:1.1.1.p59\\\", markdown \\\"– А скажите, пожалуйста, – спросил один коротышка, – у вас в бутылке была вода или, может быть, какой-нибудь другой напиток?\\\" Again, starts with a dash, then the quote, then \\\"спросил один коротышка\\\". So the speaker is \\\"один коротышка\\\" but it's after the quote. So the paragraph doesn't start with the name followed by a colon. It starts with a dash and the dialogue.\\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So maybe the structure should be like \\\"Знайка: Ну так вот...\\\" but in the current batch, the paragraphs start with a dash and then the quote, followed by the speaker's action. So maybe the actual name isn't at the start of the paragraph. For example, in standard dialogue formatting, sometimes it's written as \\\"Знайка: \\\" followed by the quote. But in the given markdown, it's \\\"– Ну так вот, – продолжал Знайка. – Убедившись...\\\" So the speaker is mentioned after the quote, not at the beginning. So the paragraph starts with a dash, not the name. So maybe there's no paragraph that starts with a character's name followed by a colon.\\n\\nBut let's check again. The first paragraph: \\\"Некоторые от нетерпения даже застучали по полу ногами.\\\" No name at all. Second paragraph starts with \\\"– Ну так вот, – продолжал Знайка...\\\" So the first part is a dash, then the quote, then \\\"продолжал Знайка\\\". So the name \\\"Знайка\\\" is part of the sentence after the quote. So the paragraph doesn't start with the name. Similarly, third paragraph starts with \\\"– А скажите, пожалуйста, – спросил один коротышка...\\\" So again, the name \\\"один коротышка\\\" comes after the quote.\\n\\nSo none of the paragraphs start with a character's name followed by a colon. The task is looking for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon. So maybe there's no such evidence here.\\n\\nWait, but maybe the \\\"–\\\" is considered similar to a colon? Like in some formats, dialogue is written with a dash instead of a colon. But the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So if the paragraph starts with the name and then a colon or dash. But in the current batch, the paragraphs start with a dash, then the quote, then the speaker's action. So the name isn't at the start. For example, if it was \\\"Знайка: Ну так вот...\\\", then that would start with the name followed by a colon. But here, it's \\\"– Ну так вот, – продолжал Знайка...\\\", which is different.\\n\\nSo perhaps there are no paragraphs that start with a character's name followed by a colon or similar. Therefore, no evidence found.\\n\\nBut let's check again. Let's look at each paragraph's markdown:\\n\\n60:1.1.1.p57: \\\"Некоторые от нетерпения даже застучали по полу ногами.\\\" — no name, no colon.\\n\\n61:1.1.1.p58: \\\"– Ну так вот, – продолжал Знайка. – Убедившись, что всё в порядке...\\\" — starts with a dash, then quote, then \\\"продолжал Знайка\\\". So the name is in the middle of the paragraph, not at the start.\\n\\n62:1.1.1.p59: \\\"– А скажите, пожалуйста, – спросил один коротышка, – у вас в бутылке была вода...\\\" — same structure. Starts with dash, quote, then speaker.\\n\\nSo none of the paragraphs start with a character's name followed by a colon or similar. Therefore, there's no evidence in this batch.\\n\\nThe task says to check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon. Since none of the current batch items meet that criteria, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there's more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), but no new evidence found here.\\n\\nWait, the output needs to have \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue|done|not_found\\\". Since there's no evidence in this batch, and hasMoreBatches is true, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there might be more batches to check. But the \\\"not_found\\\" decision is when there's no evidence and no more batches? Wait, the rules say: if maxEvidenceCount is provided and reached, done. But here maxEvidenceCount is null. So the decision is based on whether there's new evidence. If there's no new evidence, but hasMoreBatches is true, then decision is \\\"continue\\\". If there's no evidence and no more batches, then \\\"not_found\\\". But in this case, hasMoreBatches is true, so even if no evidence here, decision is \\\"continue\\\".\\n\\nBut the output schema says decision can be \\\"continue\\\", \\\"done\\\", or \\\"not_found\\\". So if there's no new evidence, but there are more batches, then \\\"continue\\\". If there's no evidence and no more batches, then \\\"not_found\\\". If enough evidence found, \\\"done\\\".\\n\\nIn this case, the current batch has no evidence (since none of the paragraphs start with a name followed by colon), so newEvidence is empty. So decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because hasMoreBatches is true.\\n\\nBut wait, the task says \\\"Check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different. If found, return the names and the dialogue text.\\\"\\n\\nSo the current batch doesn't have any such paragraphs. So newEvidence is empty. So the JSON should have newEvidence as an empty array, and decision \\\"continue\\\".\\n\\nBut let's check the rules again: \\\"Do NOT add evidence for a pointer that appears in snapshot.recentEvidencePointers.\\\" But snapshot.recentEvidencePointers is empty, so no issue. Also, the excerpt must be copied exactly. But since there's no matching evidence, newEvidence is empty.\\n\\nSo the output should be:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\",\\n  \\\"newEvidence\\\": []\\n}\\n\\nYes. Because there's no evidence in this batch, but there are more batches to check (hasMoreBatches is true), so decision is continue.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1046,\"completion_tokens\":1847,\"total_tokens\":2893}}\n",
