Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to find the relevant section. The user mentioned \\\"Солнечном городе,\\\" which translates to \\\"Solar City.\\\" The keywords involved are \\\"астрономы\\\" (astronomers), \\\"поссорились\\\" (fought), \\\"разделились\\\" (split), \\\"вулканисты\\\" (volcanologists), and \\\"метеоритчики\\\" (meteoritologists). \\n\\nIn the previous step, I created a keyword cursor with these terms. The response from the tool was \\\"keyword_cursor_0,\\\" which I assume is the cursor name. Now, I need to read batches from this cursor to find the exact paragraph.\\n\\nI'll start by using the cursor-read_cursor_batch function with the cursor name \\\"keyword_cursor_0.\\\" This will retrieve the next portion of the document that matches the keywords. I'll check each batch for the specific event mentioned. Since the user is looking for a detailed description of the conflict and split, I need to ensure I read through all relevant sections until I find the exact mention. If the first batch doesn't have it, I'll continue reading subsequent batches. Once found, I'll note the pointer and finalize the answer.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_1ks8nd9l\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1267,\"completion_tokens\":316,\"total_tokens\":1583}}\n",
