Request further data.\\\u0022}\u0022,\u0022reasoning\u0022:\u0022We need to find LineIndex=47 within this heading. The provided items start at line 49 onward. So need earlier lines (45-48). Not yet seen; need continue fetching earlier? Cursor is forward, meaning we are moving forward; we started at line 49. To get line 47, we need to go back a bit. Likely need next chunk earlier in document: maybe previous cursor items before line 49 but not provided. Since we have forward cursor, we may need to request previous part? But we can continue forward until we perhaps encounter line 47? Unlikely because line numbers increase. So we need to go back. However maybe line index resets per heading? Could be that line index is relative to heading content, and maybe earlier lines appear later due to offset? But seems line numbers increasing sequentially throughout heading. So line 47 should be before line 49, not yet seen. We need to get earlier portion. Since we only have forward cursor, maybe we need to request earlier part with a new cursor? The system provides sequential portions; we can continue to request but it\u0027ll give later lines (\\u003e=49). So we need to signal that we need previous lines; maybe we can request backward? Not possible. Probably they expect we request more until we find line 47 (maybe line numbers not monotonic? But line 49 had offset 12063, line 51 offset 12477, line 53 offset 12660, etc. So line 47 would have lower offset, earlier. It hasn\u0027t been provided yet. So we need to continue the cursor backwards? The cursor is whole book forward, starting at beginning? It appears we are somewhere in the document around line 49; earlier lines would have been delivered earlier, but not shown. Possibly they expect that we need to request previous context: use same cursor? The cursor likely continues forward; can\u0027t go back. Maybe they want us to respond \\\u0022continue\\\u0022 and request more items until we hit the desired line index. So status continue.\\n\\nThus reply with continue.\u0022},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022stop\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:4848,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:455,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:5303}}\n",
