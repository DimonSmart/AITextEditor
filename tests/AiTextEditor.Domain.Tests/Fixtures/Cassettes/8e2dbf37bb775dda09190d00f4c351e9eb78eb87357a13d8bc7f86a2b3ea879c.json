Need canonicalName normalized nominative. The name \\\"Знайка\\\" is presumably a nickname; it's a proper name. Canonical maybe \\\"Знайка\\\". Aliases: maybe just that; there is no other form in text. Gender? In Russian, \\\"Знайка\\\" is a character from \\\"Приключения Незнайки\\\" male? Actually \\\"Знайка\\\" is male, I think. In Russian children's book, \\\"Знайка\\\" is male (one of the characters). But we need to base on evidence: the text uses first person \\\"я\\\" but gender not evident. No explicit gender. Could we infer male from typical usage? The rule: Use \\\"unknown\\\" if not supported by evidence. There's no gender clue. So gender unknown.\\n\\nDescription: 1-3 sentences grounded: He is a character who says he was not wandering, but he flew in a rocket and observed objects in weightlessness.\\n\\nThus produce JSON array with one object.\\n\\nAliases: none, but maybe same.
