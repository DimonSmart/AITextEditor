The user wants me to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the provided batch. The task says to look at all paragraphs containing that term. The current batch has three items, all of which are headings. The first is a main heading, then a subheading, and another subheading. None of these headings mention \\\"Фуксии\\\". The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty. Since the user is using the first batch and there's more batches coming, I need to check each item's markdown content. But in this batch, there are no paragraphs with \\\"Фуксии\\\". So the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no evidence here. I shouldn't add anything to newEvidence since none of the pointers in the batch items contain the required term. The output should be a JSON object with decision as \\\"not_found\\\" and an empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":655,\"completion_tokens\":210,\"total_tokens\":865}}\n",
