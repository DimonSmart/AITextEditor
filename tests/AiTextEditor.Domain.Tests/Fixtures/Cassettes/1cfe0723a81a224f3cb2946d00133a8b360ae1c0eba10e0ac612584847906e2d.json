The task is to find the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" (Ponchik). The user provided a snapshot with evidenceCount 1 and recentEvidencePointers including \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". But since the current batch doesn't include that pointer, I need to check the current items.\\n\\nLooking at the batch items, all the pointers start from 74:1.1.1.p71 onwards. The snapshot's recent pointer is 6:1.1.1.p3, which isn't in the current batch. So, I need to scan the current batch's items for any mention of \\\"Пончик\\\".\\n\\nGoing through each item's markdown:\\n\\n- 74:1.1.1.p71: Talks about Звёздочкин, not Ponchik.\\n- 75:1.1.1.p72: \\\"Долой!\\\" – no.\\n- 76:1.1.1.p73: Mentions Звёздочкин again.\\n- 77:1.1.1.p74: Same as above.\\n- 78:1.1.1.p75: Звёздочкин's reaction.\\n- 79:1.1.1.p76: He shouts about complaining and writing to the newspaper.\\n- 80:1.1.1.p77: Still about Звёздочкин.\\n- 81:1.1.1.p78: Closing the meeting.\\n- 82:1.1.1.p79: Leaving home.\\n- 83:1.2: Heading for chapter two.\\n- 84:1.2.1: Subheading about the moon stone puzzle.\\n- 85:1.2.1.p1: Discusses the newspaper report, Знайкиной book, and mentions коротышки (dwarfs), but no Ponchik.\\n- 86:1.2.1.p2: Truncated, so can't check.\\n\\nNone of these paragraphs mention \\\"Пончик\\\". The snapshot's evidence might be from a previous batch, but the current batch doesn't have any references. So, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there's no new evidence here. The user might need to check earlier batches or confirm if the current batch is complete.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1464,\"completion_tokens\":525,\"total_tokens\":1989}}\n",
