The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with two character names followed by dialogue. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, all the entries are paragraphs. The first paragraph (18:1.1.1.p15) is a single sentence without any dialogue or character names. The second paragraph (19:1.1.1.p16) mentions Znayka responding, but it's a single line of dialogue without another character's name. The third paragraph (20:1.1.1.p17) has a dialogue where Znayka is called a \\\"блинистом\\\" by others, but again, it's a single line. \\n\\nWait, maybe the second paragraph has Znayka's response, but there's no second character mentioned. The third paragraph has the other characters (vulcanists and meteoritists) responding to Znayka, but again, it's a single line. The task requires two character names followed by dialogue. None of the paragraphs have two names. So there's no evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there's no matching dialog between two characters.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":903,\"completion_tokens\":286,\"total_tokens\":1189}}\n",
