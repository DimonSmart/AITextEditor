The user is asking for the second mention of Professor Zvezdochin in the book, excluding headers. \\n\\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the tools available. There's a function to create a cursor for searching, then run the agent to find specific mentions. The user already created a cursor called 'search_cursor' and ran the agent to find the second mention.\\n\\nLooking at the tool response, the evidence list has four pointers. The first excerpt mentions Professor Zvezdochin in the context of proposing a discussion, which is the first mention. The second excerpt is a direct mention in a conversation. The third and fourth are subsequent mentions. \\n\\nWait, the user wants the second mention. The first evidence item is the first mention, so the second would be the second excerpt. But the tool response says the decision is 'done' and the cursor is complete. The user's answer should be the second excerpt's pointer. Let me check the excerpts again. \\n\\nThe first excerpt (pointer 25) is the first mention. The second excerpt (pointer 50) is the second mention. The third and fourth are later. So the answer should be pointer 50:1.1.1.p47. The user wants the second mention, so that's the correct one. I need to present this in Russian and include the pointer label.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1552,\"completion_tokens\":387,\"total_tokens\":1939}}\n",
