The user wants me to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The task says to look for lines with at least two named characters in a dialogue format. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once I find one, I should set the decision to \\\"done\\\".\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, the items are all headings. The first item is a main heading, then a subheading, and another subheading. None of these seem to be dialogues. The user mentioned that the snapshot has an evidence count of 0 and no recent pointers, so I need to check the current batch items.\\n\\nSince all the items in the batch are headings and not actual dialogue lines, there's no excerpt that contains a dialogue between two named characters. The pointers are for headings, not for any dialogue content. Therefore, there's no evidence to report here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required evidence isn't present in the current batch. I should output that and wait for the next batch if there is one.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":657,\"completion_tokens\":228,\"total_tokens\":885}}\n",
