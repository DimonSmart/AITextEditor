The user wants me to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin and describe his character trait of boiling with outrage. The context is mentions of 'профессор Звёздочкин', and the max evidence count is 1. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so I need to look for any mentions of профессор Звёздочкин in the current batch.\\n\\nLooking at the items, the first batch has headings and paragraphs. The third item is a heading: \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". That's a mention of Professor Zvezdokhin. The paragraph following this heading (pointer 4:1.1.1.p1) starts talking about Незнайка's journey and the changes in the city, but doesn't mention the professor. The next paragraphs discuss other characters like Пончик and the changes in the city. \\n\\nWait, the heading mentions the professor, but the actual paragraphs don't talk about him. The task is to find the first mention and describe his trait. Since the heading is the first mention, but the paragraphs don't describe his trait. However, the user's instruction says to use content from the current batch. The heading is part of the batch, so maybe the heading itself is the evidence. But the reason needs to be local and factual. The heading mentions that Знайка defeated the professor, but that's about an event, not his trait. \\n\\nWait, maybe there's a paragraph that mentions the professor's trait. Let me check again. The paragraphs after the heading discuss other characters. The only mention of the professor is in the heading. Since the task requires describing his trait of boiling with outrage, but the current batch doesn't have any paragraph that describes that trait. The heading just mentions that Знайка defeated him, but that's not a trait. \\n\\nHmm, maybe the answer is that there's no evidence in the current batch. But the user's instruction says to report all matches. The heading is a mention, but the trait isn't described here. So the decision would be 'not_found' because the trait isn't present. But the user might expect the heading as the first mention, even if the trait isn't there. Wait, the task says to describe the character trait of boiling with outrage. If the current batch doesn't have that, then the answer is not found. \\n\\nWait, looking again, maybe I missed something. The paragraph 4:1.1.1.p1 mentions that after Незнайка's trip, many corотышки went to the Sun City and made improvements. Then it talks about the city changes, but no mention of the professor. The heading is the first mention, but the trait isn't described here. Therefore, there's no evidence in the current batch for the trait. So the decision is 'not_found'. But the user might have intended the heading as the first mention, even if the trait isn't there. However, according to the rules, the reason must be local and factual. Since the trait isn't present, the answer is not found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2040,\"completion_tokens\":690,\"total_tokens\":2730}}\n",
