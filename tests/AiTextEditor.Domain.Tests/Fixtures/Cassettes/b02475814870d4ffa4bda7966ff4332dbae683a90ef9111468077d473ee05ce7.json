The user asked to find the first mention of Professor Zv\u0451zdogkin and rewrite the paragraph, adding that the apples started to bloom at that moment. \\n\\nThe assistant used the RunCursorAgent function with the cursor name \\\u0022ZvezdokinCursor\\\u0022, mode \\\u0022FirstMatch\\\u0022, and the task description. But the response said the cursor wasn\u0027t found. Hmm. \\n\\nWait, maybe the cursor wasn\u0027t created yet. The RunCursorAgent function might require the cursor to already exist. Let me check the available functions again. There\u0027s a CreateCursor function. Oh right! The assistant didn\u0027t create the cursor first. They jumped straight to running the agent without initializing the cursor. That\u0027s why it\u0027s missing.\\n\\nSo the correct steps should be: first, create a cursor using CreateCursor with a name like \\\u0022ZvezdokinCursor\\\u0022, set the parameters like forward, maxElements, etc. Then, use RunCursorAgent to navigate through the cursor. But the user\u0027s initial request didn\u0027t mention creating a cursor, so maybe the assistant assumed the cursor already exists. But in the system, the cursor wasn\u0027t created, leading to the error.\\n\\nTherefore, the next step is to create the cursor first. Let me call CreateCursor with the appropriate parameters. Let\u0027s name it \\\u0022ZvezdokinCursor\\\u0022, set forward to true, includeContent to true, and reasonable maxElements and maxBytes. Then, proceed with RunCursorAgent. But wait, the user might not have provided the text to search through. Maybe the cursor is supposed to be over a specific dataset. Since the user didn\u0027t specify, perhaps the assistant needs to clarify. However, given the tools, maybe the cursor is created in the system, and the RunCursorAgent function is supposed to handle the search. But the error suggests the cursor doesn\u0027t exist. \\n\\nSo the correct approach is to first create the cursor using CreateCursor, then run the agent. Let me adjust the response to create the cursor first.\\n\u0022,\u0022tool_calls\u0022:[{\u0022id\u0022:\u0022call_4lvcslgt\u0022,\u0022index\u0022:0,\u0022type\u0022:\u0022function\u0022,\u0022function\u0022:{\u0022name\u0022:\u0022CursorAgentPlugin-CreateCursor\u0022,\u0022arguments\u0022:\u0022{\\\u0022cursorName\\\u0022:\\\u0022ZvezdokinCursor\\\u0022,\\\u0022forward\\\u0022:true,\\\u0022includeContent\\\u0022:true,\\\u0022maxBytes\\\u0022:1048576,\\\u0022maxElements\\\u0022:100}\u0022}}]},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022tool_calls\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:815,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:480,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:1295}}\n",
