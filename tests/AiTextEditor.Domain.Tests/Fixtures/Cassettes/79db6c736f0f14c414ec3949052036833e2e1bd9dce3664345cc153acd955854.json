The user wants me to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the provided batch items. First, I need to scan each item's markdown content carefully. \\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer 51:1.1.1.p48, the markdown talks about two small guys grabbing Zvezdokhin and taking him off the tribune. There's no mention of Фуксии here.\\n\\nNext, pointer 52:1.1.1.p49 mentions people shouting for Znayka to give a report and getting rid of Zvezdokhin. Still no Фуксии.\\n\\nThe third item, pointer 53:1.1.1.p50, has Znayka saying he can't give a report because he wasn't prepared. Again, no sign of Фуксии. \\n\\nNone of the paragraphs in the current batch contain the term \\\"Фуксии\\\". The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but that's from a previous batch. Since the current batch doesn't have any matches, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 10, but since there are no new evidences, the decision remains not_found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":802,\"completion_tokens\":288,\"total_tokens\":1090}}\n",
