The user wants me to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. The context is paragraphs with at least two named characters. The maxEvidenceCount is null, so I don't need to worry about a limit here.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan the current batch items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and recentEvidencePointers is empty. The batch has three items, all headings. The first is a main heading, then a chapter heading, and then a section heading. \\n\\nWait, the user mentioned that the task is to find dialogue between two named characters. But the current batch items are all headings. There's no markdown content here. The headings don't contain any dialogue; they're just titles. \\n\\nSince the items are headings and there's no actual paragraph or list item with dialogue, there's no evidence to report. The user might be expecting the next batch to have the actual content, but according to the input provided, this is the first batch and there's more batches coming. However, based on the current data, there's nothing to extract. \\n\\nThe rules say to use only the current batch's content. Since there are no paragraphs or list items with dialogue here, the newEvidence array should be empty. The decision would be \\\"continue\\\" because there's no evidence found, and the agent needs to process more batches. \\n\\nI should make sure not to include any pointers from the recentEvidencePointers since the snapshot is empty. Also, the reason for the decision should be that no dialogue was found in the current batch. So the output JSON will have decision as \\\"continue\\\" and an empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":658,\"completion_tokens\":359,\"total_tokens\":1017}}\n",
