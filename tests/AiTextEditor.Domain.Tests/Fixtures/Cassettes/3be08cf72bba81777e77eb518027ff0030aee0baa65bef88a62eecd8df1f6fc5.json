The user wants a paragraph describing two rotating buildings on Kolokolchikov Street with a spiral descent and a devil's wheel on the roof. The context includes the keywords 'Колокольчиков', 'вертящихся зданий', 'спиральный спуск', and 'чёртовым колесом'. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check the current batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, but the user is asking for more. The batch has two items. Let me look at each one.\\n\\nThe first item (10:1.1.1.p7) talks about lunar craters and scientists arguing between volcanic and meteorite theories. No mention of buildings or the required keywords. The second item (11:1.1.1.p8) describes Znayka's theory about lunar craters comparing them to pancakes. Still, no relevant terms here. \\n\\nNeither of these paragraphs mention Kolokolchikov Street, rotating buildings, spiral descent, or the devil's wheel. The keywords in the context aren't present in the provided text. Since the task requires specific terms that aren't found in the current batch, there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be 'not_found' because the required information isn't present here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1151,\"completion_tokens\":295,\"total_tokens\":1446}}\n",
