But the current batch items don't have any mention of that professor. The items are paragraphs from different pointers, but none of their markdown content includes the required term. So, there's no new evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there are no matches in the current batch. Also, the user mentioned that if the evidence count plus new evidence meets maxEvidenceCount, set decision to \\\"done\\\", but here, since there's no new evidence, it's \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":811,\"completion_tokens\":167,\"total_tokens\":978}}\n",
