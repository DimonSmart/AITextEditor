The user wants to find the first mention of \\\"Фуксия\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to see if \\\"Фуксия\\\" appears. \\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", the markdown content is about Ponchik and his clothes. I'll check if \\\"Фуксия\\\" is there. Scanning through the text, I don't see that word. \\n\\nNext, the second item has pointer \\\"7:1.1.1.p4\\\". The markdown here talks about the moth problem and the smell from the naphthalene. Again, I'll search for \\\"Фуксия\\\". Still no luck. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first paragraph mentions various items like костюмы (costumes) and Огурцовой реке (Gherkin River), but no Фуксия. The second paragraph discusses the moth and the smell, but again, no mention of Фуксия. \\n\\nHmm, the task says to find the first mention, but neither of these paragraphs have it. The snapshot has evidenceCount 0, and recentEvidencePointers is empty. Since the batch items don't contain \\\"Фуксия\\\", there's no new evidence to add. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required term isn't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1271,\"completion_tokens\":325,\"total_tokens\":1596}}\n",
