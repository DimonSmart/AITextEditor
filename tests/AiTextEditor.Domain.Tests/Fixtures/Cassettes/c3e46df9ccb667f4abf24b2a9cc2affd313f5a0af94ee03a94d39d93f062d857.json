The user wants me to find the first dialogue between two named characters in the given batch. The task says to look through all paragraphs, and the maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once I find one, I should stop.\\n\\nLooking at the batch items, there are three items, all headings. The first is a main heading \\\"Часть I\\\", then \\\"Глава первая\\\", and then \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". These are all headings, not paragraphs. The user mentioned to ignore headings unless the task asks for them. Since the task is about dialogues between named characters, headings probably don't contain the necessary info.\\n\\nThe snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and no recent pointers. The user's instruction says to use only the current batch's content. Since there are no paragraphs in the batch items, there's no excerpt to check. Therefore, there's no evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there are no applicable items in the current batch that contain a dialogue between named characters. I need to output that in the JSON as specified.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":648,\"completion_tokens\":250,\"total_tokens\":898}}\n",
