The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with exactly two character names followed by dialogue markers. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, all the pointers are paragraphs from a story about Знайка and лунатики. The first paragraph (21:1.1.1.p18) talks about Знайка rejecting his theory after visiting the Moon. There's no dialogue here, just narrative.\\n\\nThe second paragraph (22:1.1.1.p19) mentions Знайка realizing the walls were made by intelligent beings and publishing a book. Still, it's a narrative summary, not a dialogue. The third paragraph (23:1.1.1.p20) continues the story about the лунатики moving inside the Moon. Again, no dialogue tags with two names.\\n\\nSince the task requires dialogue markers with two names, and none of the provided paragraphs have that, there's no evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required dialog isn't present in the current batch. Also, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and adding nothing from this batch would keep it at 0, so \\\"done\\\" isn't applicable. Hence, \\\"not_found\\\" is the correct choice.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1297,\"completion_tokens\":305,\"total_tokens\":1602}}\n",
