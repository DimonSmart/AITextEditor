The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with exactly two character names followed by dialogue markers. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, all the entries are paragraphs. The first paragraph (18:1.1.1.p15) is a single sentence without any dialogue markers or character names. The second paragraph (19:1.1.1.p16) mentions \\\"Знайка\\\" responding, but there's only one name here. The third paragraph (20:1.1.1.p17) has \\\"Знайку\\\" and the other side is \\\"они\\\" which refers to the volcanologists and meteoritists. However, the task requires exactly two character names. \\n\\nWait, in the third paragraph, \\\"они\\\" might be referring to the previous mentioned groups, but the names aren't explicitly stated. The only named character is Знайка. The other side is a group, not a named character. So maybe there's no dialog between two named characters here. \\n\\nBut the user's task says \\\"two named characters,\\\" so if \\\"они\\\" isn't a named character, then there's no match. The second paragraph has Знайка talking, but no other named character. The first paragraph has no dialogue. So maybe there's no evidence here. But the user's snapshot has evidenceCount 0, so maybe the answer is not_found. However, the user might have expected Знайка and the others as two characters. Wait, the task says \\\"two named characters,\\\" so if \\\"они\\\" is considered as a named character (like \\\"вулканисты и метеоритчики\\\"), but they are groups, not individual characters. So perhaps there's no valid evidence here. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":905,\"completion_tokens\":421,\"total_tokens\":1326}}\n",
