The user is asking where in the document it's mentioned that the clothing factory produced everything, from rubber bras to synthetic fur coats. First, I need to figure out how to approach this.\\n\\nThe user wants specific information about the factory's product range. Since the document is loaded into the kernel functions, I should use the provided tools to search for this. The tools include creating a cursor and running an agent to scan the document. \\n\\nI'll start by creating a cursor with a filter that looks for mentions of the factory producing a wide variety of items. The filter description should be stateless, so I can't use counters or track occurrences. Instead, I'll look for keywords like \\\"всё подряд\\\", \\\"резиновые лифчики\\\", and \\\"синтетическое волокно\\\". \\n\\nWait, the user mentioned \\\"от резиновых лифчиков до зимних шуб из синтетического волокна\\\", so the exact phrases might be in the document. I need to create a cursor that filters for these terms. The cursor name could be \\\"search_cursor\\\" with a filter description that includes these keywords. \\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, I'll run the agent to find the first mention. The maxEvidenceCount should be set to 1 to get the first occurrence. If the first result doesn't contain all the mentioned items, I might need to adjust, but the user is asking for the first mention. \\n\\nI should check the response from the agent. If the evidence item includes all the required terms, that's the answer. If not, maybe the cursor needs to be adjusted. But since the user is asking for the first mention, the first evidence item should suffice. \\n\\nAlso, I need to make sure to include the pointerLabel in the summary. If the answer is found, return it in Russian with the semantic pointer. If not, state that it's not found. Let's proceed with creating the cursor and running the agent.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_r55175ra\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"Contains the terms 'всё подряд', 'резиновые лифчики', 'синтетическое волокно' or similar product range descriptions\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1088,\"completion_tokens\":493,\"total_tokens\":1581}}\n",
