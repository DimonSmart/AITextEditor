Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I tried creating a cursor with CreateCursor to set up a cursor for processing the book\u0027s content. Then, I used QueryCursor to find the first occurrence of \u0027\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027 and get its semantic pointer. But there was an error, and the function invocation was canceled. Hmm, why did that happen?\\n\\nMaybe the query instruction wasn\u0027t specific enough, or the cursor didn\u0027t have the necessary data. Alternatively, there might be an issue with how the query is structured. Let me check the parameters again. The cursor was created with forward direction, includeText true, and default max elements and bytes. The query instruction was to find the first occurrence. Perhaps the system couldn\u0027t process that instruction correctly, or the text wasn\u0027t found in the initial portions.\\n\\nNext steps: Maybe I need to use GetNextPortion to manually check the content step by step. Alternatively, adjust the query instruction to be more precise. Or maybe use MapCursor to process each portion and look for the keyword. Let me try using MapCursor with an instruction to search for \u0027\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027 in each portion and note the position. That way, even if the query didn\u0027t work before, processing each part might reveal where it\u0027s mentioned first.\\n\\nWait, the error was about the invocation being canceled. Maybe the QueryCursor function isn\u0027t suitable here, and a different approach is needed. Let\u0027s try using MapCursor to iterate through each portion and check for the keyword. If found, record the pointer. That should handle it even if the query wasn\u0027t properly formed before.\\n\u0022,\u0022tool_calls\u0022:[{\u0022id\u0022:\u0022call_lfvdgawz\u0022,\u0022index\u0022:0,\u0022type\u0022:\u0022function\u0022,\u0022function\u0022:{\u0022name\u0022:\u0022NavigationPlugin-MapCursor\u0022,\u0022arguments\u0022:\u0022{\\\u0022cursorName\\\u0022:\\\u0022profZvezdokhinCursor\\\u0022,\\\u0022instruction\\\u0022:\\\u0022Search for \u0027\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027 in each portion.
