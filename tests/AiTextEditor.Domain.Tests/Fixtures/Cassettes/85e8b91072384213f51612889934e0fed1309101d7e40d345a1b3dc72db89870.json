Let me start by recalling the previous interaction. The user first asked about the second occurrence, and I created a keyword cursor for \\\"Zvezdokhin\\\". The response from the tool was \\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\", which probably means the cursor was created successfully.\\n\\nNow, I need to use the chat_cursor_agent to process this cursor and find the second mention. The agent will read batches from the cursor. Since the user wants the second occurrence, I should set the maxEvidenceCount to 2 to capture both instances. The task description should be clear about finding the second mention. I'll call the run_chat_cursor_agent with the cursor name and the task description. Then, after getting the results, I'll check the pointers to identify the second occurrence's location. If the results have two entries, the second one is the answer. If not, I might need to adjust the parameters or check if there's only one mention. But based on the tool response, it's likely there are enough occurrences. Finally, I'll format the answer in Russian, including the semantic pointer as specified.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_8rg43b0y\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"chat_cursor_agent-run_chat_cursor_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":2,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Найти второе упоминание профессора Звёздочкина (исключая заголовки)\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1136,\"completion_tokens\":316,\"total_tokens\":1452}}\n",
