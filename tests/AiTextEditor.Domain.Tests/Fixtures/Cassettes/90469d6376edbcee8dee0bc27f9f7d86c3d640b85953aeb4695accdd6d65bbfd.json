The user is asking where in the text it says that Znayka stayed on the Moon for about four hours and had to return urgently due to air issues.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the previous interaction. The user asked the same question before, and the assistant used the CursorAgentPlugin to find the relevant section. The tool response pointed to a specific paragraph where Znayka and his companions had to leave the Moon because their air supply ran out after four hours.\\n\\nNow, the user is probably looking for the exact location in the document. The tool response provided a semantic pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\" which points to the paragraph where this information is located. The excerpt mentions that they stayed for four hours and had to return due to air supply issues. \\n\\nI should confirm that this is the correct location. The answer needs to be in Russian and include the semantic pointer. Since the tool response already identified this paragraph, the answer should reference that pointer. The user might be verifying the answer or needing the citation for the information. \\n\\nSo, the final answer should state that the information is found in the paragraph with the semantic pointer 8:1.1.1.p5, mentioning the four-hour stay and the air supply problem.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1030,\"completion_tokens\":354,\"total_tokens\":1384}}\n",
