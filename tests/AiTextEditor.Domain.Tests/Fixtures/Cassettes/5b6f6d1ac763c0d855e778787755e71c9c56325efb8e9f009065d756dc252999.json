The user is asking where in the document it's described how astronomers in the Solar City got into a fight and split into volcanologists and meteoritologists.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out the right approach. The user mentioned \\\"Солнечный город,\\\" which translates to \\\"Solar City.\\\" So, I should look for mentions of Solar City and the conflict between the two groups. \\n\\nSince the tools available include creating a cursor and running an agent, I should start by creating a cursor to search for relevant sections. The filter description should be something like \\\"mentions of astronomers in Solar City arguing and splitting into volcanologists and meteoritologists.\\\" \\n\\nWait, the user specified \\\"поссорились и разделились на вулканистов и метеоритчиков,\\\" which is \\\"got into a fight and split into volcanologists and meteoritologists.\\\" So the exact terms might be important. I need to make sure the cursor looks for those exact phrases.\\n\\nI'll create a cursor with the name \\\"conflict_cursor\\\" and the filter description as \\\"mentions of astronomers in Solar City arguing and splitting into volcanologists and meteoritologists.\\\" Then, run the agent on that cursor to find the first occurrence. \\n\\nBut I should check if the document even has that information. If the cursor returns no results, then the answer isn't in the document. Alternatively, maybe the terms are different, like \\\"volcanic\\\" and \\\"meteorite\\\" instead of \\\"вулканистов\\\" and \\\"метеоритчиков.\\\" Wait, the user used the exact terms, so I should stick with them.\\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, the agent will scan the document. If it finds a relevant paragraph, the evidence item will be returned. I need to make sure to check the first occurrence and include the pointer label. If not found, I should inform the user that it's not in the document.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_0aise2mh\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"mentions of astronomers in Solar City arguing and splitting into volcanologists and meteoritologists\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":10485760,\\\"name\\\":\\\"conflict_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1146,\"completion_tokens\":462,\"total_tokens\":1608}}\n",
