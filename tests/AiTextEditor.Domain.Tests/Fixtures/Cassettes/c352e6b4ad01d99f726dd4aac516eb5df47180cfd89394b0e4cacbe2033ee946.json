The user wants the first mention of Фуксия and Селедочка. Wait, the task says \\\"Find the first mention of Фуксия and Селедочка,\\\" but looking at the provided batch items, none of the paragraphs mention those names. The paragraphs are about lunar craters and meteorites, discussing shapes and theories. The snapshot's recent evidence pointer is 8:1.1.1.p5, which isn't in the current batch. The current batch items 15, 16, 17 don't have Фуксия or Селедочка. So, there's no evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the names aren't present in the current batch. No new evidence to add.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":901,\"completion_tokens\":180,\"total_tokens\":1081}}\n",
