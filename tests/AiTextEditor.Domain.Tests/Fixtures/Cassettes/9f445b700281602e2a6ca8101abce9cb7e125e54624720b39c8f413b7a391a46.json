The user wants the first two mentions of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\". But looking at the provided batch items, none of the paragraphs contain that exact phrase. The first paragraph talks about Знайка's theory about the Moon's surface, but not Звёздочкина. The second paragraph mentions astronomers laughing at Знайка's theory, still no Звёздочкина. The third paragraph starts with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\", which is about volcanologists, not Звёздочкина. Since the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"3:1.1.1\\\", which might be from a previous batch, but the current batch doesn't have any matches. So, there's no new evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required mentions aren't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1098,\"completion_tokens\":201,\"total_tokens\":1299}}\n",
