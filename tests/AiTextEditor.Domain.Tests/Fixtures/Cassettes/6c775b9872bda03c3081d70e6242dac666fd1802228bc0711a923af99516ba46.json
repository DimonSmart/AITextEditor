The user wants the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to find where \\\"Пончик\\\" appears.\\n\\nLooking at the first item (pointer 27:1.1.1.p24), the markdown is about a meeting discussing Znayka's book. No mention of Пончик here. \\n\\nNext, the second item (pointer 28:1.1.1.p25) has a long paragraph. The professor talks about Znayka's book, mentions a mistake with bricks and a mountainous rock, and discusses the impossibility of little people on the Moon. Still no Пончик here. \\n\\nThe third item (pointer 29:1.1.1.p26) starts with Znayka standing up and speaking mockingly. The excerpt here is \\\"Выслушав всё это, Знайка поднялся со своего места и сказал насмешливо:\\\" which translates to \\\"After hearing all this, Znayka stood up from his seat and said mockingly:\\\". Still no Пончик. \\n\\nWait, the user mentioned that the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch doesn't have that pointer. So, in the current batch, none of the items mention Пончик. \\n\\nSince the task is to find the first mention, but none are found in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". However, the user's snapshot shows evidenceCount is 1, which might mean there was a previous match. But the current batch doesn't have any new evidence. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that no new evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1048,\"completion_tokens\":396,\"total_tokens\":1444}}\n",
