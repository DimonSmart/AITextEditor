Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search through the document. The cursor should look for mentions of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". Since the user wants the first mention, I'll set the task description to find the first occurrence. I should use the cursor-create_cursor function with a filter that checks for the presence of that name in the text. The filterDescription should be something like \\\"All paragraphs containing 'профессор Звёздочкин'\\\". \\n\\nWait, the user said to exclude headings, so maybe the filter should be more specific. But the cursor's filter is applied per element, so if the headings are treated as separate elements, maybe the filter will catch the text paragraphs. Alternatively, maybe the filter can be \\\"All paragraphs\\\" to ensure it's not limited to specific sections. \\n\\nI should create the cursor with the name \\\"search_cursor\\\" and the filterDescription as \\\"All paragraphs containing 'профессор Звёздочкин'\\\". Then, run the agent with that cursor to find the first mention. If the first result is from a heading, I might need to adjust, but the user said to exclude headings, so perhaps the filter should check for the name in the text parts, not the headings. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the filter can be \\\"All paragraphs with text containing 'профессор Звёздочкин'\\\". But since the cursor is created with the filterDescription, I need to make sure that the filter is stateless and applies to each portion. \\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, running the agent with taskDescription \\\"Find the first mention of профессор Звёздочкин\\\" should give the first occurrence. If the first result is a heading, I might need to check the next batch, but the user wants the first mention in the text, not headings. So the filter should ensure that only the text paragraphs are considered. \\n\\nI think the correct approach is to create the cursor with the filterDescription as \\\"All paragraphs containing 'профессор Звёздочкин'\\\" and then run the agent to find the first occurrence. The answer will be the first evidence item from that cursor.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_59guuxyy\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"All paragraphs containing 'профессор Звёздочкин'\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"maxElements\\\":1000,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1283,\"completion_tokens\":543,\"total_tokens\":1826}}\n",
