The user wants to find the second mention of Professor Zvezdokhin, excluding headers. They provided a cursor name and max evidence count of 2.\\n\\nFirst, the assistant called the chat_cursor_agent with those parameters. The response from the tool says there's no second mention, and the pointer is at the end. That suggests the cursor reached the end of the document without finding the second instance.\\n\\nWait, maybe the cursor was set up to look for keywords related to Zvezdokhin. But the tool's response indicates that even after reading the entire document, there's no second occurrence. So the answer should state that the second mention wasn't found. The pointer being \\\"end\\\" means the cursor has finished reading. Therefore, the final answer in Russian should confirm that there's no second mention and the pointer is at the end.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1076,\"completion_tokens\":230,\"total_tokens\":1306}}\n",
