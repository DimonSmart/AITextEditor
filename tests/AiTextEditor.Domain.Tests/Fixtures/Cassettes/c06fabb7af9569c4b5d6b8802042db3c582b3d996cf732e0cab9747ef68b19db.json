The task is to check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different. Then return the names and the dialogue text.\\n\\nFirst, I need to look at the current batch items. The batch has three paragraphs. Let's check each one.\\n\\nThe first item: pointer \\\"30:1.1.1.p27\\\", markdown starts with \\\"– Вы рассуждаете так, будто вам уже когда-нибудь приходилось болтаться в центре Луны!\\\" So the line starts with a dash, then \\\"Вы рассуждаете...\\\" Wait, but the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". Hmm. The example here starts with a dash, not a name. Let me check the exact structure.\\n\\nWait, maybe the dash is part of the dialogue. In Russian, sometimes dialogue is marked with a dash. But the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So maybe the name comes after the dash? Let's see.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph: \\\"– Вы рассуждаете так, будто вам уже когда-нибудь приходилось болтаться в центре Луны!\\\" So the dash is followed by \\\"Вы рассуждаете...\\\" which is \\\"You reason as if...\\\" So \\\"Вы\\\" is \\\"you\\\", but that's a pronoun, not a specific character's name. Wait, but maybe the character's name is implied here. Wait, but the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So maybe the structure is like \\\"Character: text\\\" or \\\"Character - text\\\".\\n\\nBut in the given examples, the markdown starts with a dash, then the text. Let's check each item.\\n\\nFirst item: \\\"– Вы рассуждаете так, будто вам уже когда-нибудь приходилось болтаться в центре Луны!\\\" So the dash is followed by \\\"Вы рассуждаете...\\\" which is \\\"You reason...\\\". But \\\"Вы\\\" is a pronoun, not a specific name. However, maybe the character's name is part of the text. Wait, but the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So perhaps the line starts with the name, then a colon or dash.\\n\\nWait, maybe in Russian dialogue, it's common to have a dash followed by the speaker's name? Or maybe the dash is used as a dialogue marker, and the name comes after. Let me check the actual text.\\n\\nWait, looking at the first paragraph: \\\"– Вы рассуждаете так, будто вам уже когда-нибудь приходилось болтаться в центре Луны!\\\" So the dash is followed by \\\"Вы рассуждаете...\\\" which is \\\"You reason...\\\". But \\\"Вы\\\" is \\\"you\\\", which is a pronoun. However, maybe the speaker is a specific character. For example, maybe the previous context had a character named something else, but in this paragraph, the text starts with a dash and then the dialogue.\\n\\nWait, but the task is to find consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar. So perhaps the structure is like \\\"CharacterName: text\\\" or \\\"CharacterName - text\\\".\\n\\nBut in the given examples, the markdown starts with a dash, then the text. Let's check each item:\\n\\nFirst item: \\\"– Вы рассуждаете так, будто вам уже когда-нибудь приходилось болтаться в центре Луны!\\\" So the dash is followed by \\\"Вы рассуждаете...\\\" which is \\\"You reason...\\\". But \\\"Вы\\\" is a pronoun, not a specific name. However, maybe the speaker is a character whose name is implied. Wait, but the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So perhaps the name comes right after the dash. Let's see.\\n\\nWait, maybe the dash is part of the dialogue marker, and the actual name is part of the text. For example, maybe the first line is \\\"– Профессор: Вы рассуждаете...\\\" but in the given data, it's \\\"– Вы рассуждаете так...\\\". So maybe the name isn't present here. Let's check the second item.\\n\\nSecond item: \\\"– А вы будто болтались? – огрызнулся профессор.\\\" So this starts with a dash, then \\\"А вы будто болтались?\\\" which is \\\"And you were swinging?\\\" Then after the question mark, there's \\\"– огрызнулся профессор.\\\" Wait, no. Wait, the markdown is \\\"– А вы будто болтались? – огрызнулся профессор.\\\" So the structure is: dash, then the dialogue, then another dash followed by \\\"огрызнулся профессор\\\" which means \\\"retorted professor\\\". So the speaker is \\\"профессор\\\" (professor), but the name is mentioned after the dialogue, not at the start.\\n\\nThird item: \\\"– Я не болтался, – возразил Знайка, – но зато я летал в ракете и наблюдал за предметами в состоянии невесомости.\\\" So starts with dash, then \\\"Я не болтался,\\\" (I didn't swing), then \\\"возразил Знайка,\\\" which means \\\"replied Znayka\\\". So again, the speaker's name is mentioned after the dialogue.\\n\\nWait, but the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So the name should be at the beginning of the paragraph. But in these examples, the name is not at the start. The dash is followed by the dialogue, and then the speaker's name is mentioned later. For example, in the second item: \\\"– А вы будто болтались? – огрызнулся профессор.\\\" So after the dialogue, there's \\\"огрызнулся профессор\\\" which is \\\"retorted professor\\\". So the name \\\"профессор\\\" is part of the text after the dialogue.\\n\\nBut the task requires that each paragraph starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar. So maybe the structure should be like \\\"Профессор: Вы рассуждаете...\\\" but in the given data, it's \\\"– Вы рассуждаете...\\\" which is a dash followed by the dialogue, not the name.\\n\\nWait, perhaps in Russian, the standard way is to have a dash followed by the dialogue, and the speaker's name is sometimes mentioned in the text. But the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So maybe the name is at the start. Let's check the exact structure of the markdown.\\n\\nLooking at the first item: \\\"– Вы рассуждаете так, будто вам уже когда-нибудь приходилось болтаться в центре Луны!\\\" So starts with a dash, then the text. No name at the start. Similarly, second item starts with dash, then \\\"А вы будто болтались? – огрызнулся профессор.\\\" So after the dialogue, there's \\\"огрызнулся профессор\\\", which is \\\"retorted professor\\\". So the name is mentioned after the dialogue.\\n\\nThird item: \\\"– Я не болтался, – возразил Знайка, – но зато я летал в ракете и наблюдал за предметами в состоянии невесомости.\\\" So starts with dash, then \\\"Я не болтался,\\\" then \\\"возразил Знайка,\\\" which is \\\"replied Znayka\\\". So again, the name is part of the text after the dialogue.\\n\\nSo in all these cases, the paragraphs don't start with a character's name followed by a colon. Instead, they start with a dash, then the dialogue, and the speaker's name is mentioned later in the text. So maybe the task is looking for something else.\\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So each paragraph must start with the name and then a colon or similar. But in the current batch, none of the paragraphs start with a name followed by a colon. Let's check again.\\n\\nFirst paragraph: starts with \\\"– Вы рассуждаете...\\\" — the dash is a hyphen, not a colon. So the first character is a dash, then space, then \\\"Вы\\\" (you). So no name at the start.\\n\\nSecond paragraph: starts with \\\"– А вы будто болтались? – огрызнулся профессор.\\\" So again, starts with dash, then text. The \\\"огрызнулся профессор\\\" is part of the same line, but the name \\\"профессор\\\" is after the dialogue.\\n\\nThird paragraph: starts with \\\"– Я не болтался, – возразил Знайка, – но зато...\\\" — again, starts with dash, then \\\"Я не болтался,\\\" then \\\"возразил Знайка\\\" — so the name \\\"Знайка\\\" is mentioned after the dialogue.\\n\\nSo none of the paragraphs start with a character's name followed by a colon or similar. The structure is dash followed by dialogue, then speaker attribution. So the name is not at the start of the paragraph. Therefore, there's no evidence here that matches the task's criteria.\\n\\nWait, but maybe the task considers the dash as the \\\"similar\\\" to a colon. But the name still needs to be at the start. For example, if it was \\\"Профессор: Вы рассуждаете...\\\", but in the current data, it's \\\"– Вы рассуждаете...\\\", so the name isn't there. So the paragraphs don't start with a name followed by a colon or dash. The dash is part of the dialogue marker, but the name comes later.\\n\\nTherefore, in this batch, there are no paragraphs that start with a character's name followed by a colon or similar. So the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there's no evidence found here, but there are more batches (hasMoreBatches is true). Wait, but the task says to check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different.\\n\\nBut in the current batch, none of the paragraphs start with a name. So no evidence here. So newEvidence should be empty. Then decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches.\\n\\nWait, but the rules say: \\\"Do NOT add evidence for a pointer that appears in snapshot.recentEvidencePointers.\\\" But snapshot.recentEvidencePointers is empty, so that's not an issue here.\\n\\nAlso, the maxEvidenceCount is null, so no need to check for that.\\n\\nSo the newEvidence list should be empty. Then decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), and we didn't find any evidence in this batch.\\n\\nWait, but the output schema requires newEvidence to be a list. If there's no evidence, then newEvidence is empty array. Then decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches.\\n\\nYes. Because the task is to scan the current batch and extract candidate evidence. If none found, then newEvidence is empty, and decision is \\\"continue\\\" if there are more batches. If no more batches and no evidence, then \\\"not_found\\\". But here hasMoreBatches is true, so decision is \\\"continue\\\".\\n\\nSo the JSON should have decision \\\"continue\\\", newEvidence empty array.\\n\\nLet me check again. The current batch items:\\n\\nEach paragraph starts with a dash, then dialogue. The speaker's name is mentioned after the dialogue, not at the start. So the task requires each paragraph to start with a character's name followed by colon or similar. Since none of the paragraphs start with a name, there's no evidence here. So newEvidence is empty. Decision is \\\"continue\\\" because hasMoreBatches is true.\\n\\nYes. So the output should be:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\",\\n  \\\"newEvidence\\\": []\\n}\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":762,\"completion_tokens\":2565,\"total_tokens\":3327}}\n",
