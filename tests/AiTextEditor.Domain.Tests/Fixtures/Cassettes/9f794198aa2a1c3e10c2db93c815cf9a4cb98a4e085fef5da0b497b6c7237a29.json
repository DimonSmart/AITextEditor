The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that lines should have at least two named characters in a dialogue format. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items. The first item is a paragraph discussing lunar craters and two groups of astronomers. There's mention of \\\"Знайка\\\" (Znayka) and \\\"Стекляшкин\\\" (Steklyashkin). Wait, in the second paragraph, it says \\\"Знайка вместе со Стекляшкиным наблюдал Луну в телескоп.\\\" That's a dialogue? Wait, no, the text is a narrative. It says they observed the Moon together, but there's no direct dialogue between them. The paragraph is describing Znayka's observations and his theory, but it's not a dialogue. \\n\\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The task says \\\"dialogue format,\\\" which usually implies direct speech like \\\"A: ... B: ...\\\" or quotes. In the given text, there's no such structure. The second paragraph mentions Znayka and Steklyashkin observing the Moon together, but it's a narrative, not a dialogue. So there's no direct dialogue between two named characters here. \\n\\nThe first paragraph mentions \\\"вулканистами\\\" and \\\"метеоритчиками,\\\" but those are groups, not individual characters in a dialogue. So, based on the provided items, there's no evidence of a dialogue between two named characters. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the required evidence isn't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1094,\"completion_tokens\":370,\"total_tokens\":1464}}\n",
