The user wants the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to find any occurrence of that exact word.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer 60:1.1.1.p57, the markdown is \\\"Некоторые от нетерпения даже застучали по полу ногами.\\\" There's no mention of Пончик here. \\n\\nNext, the second item is pointer 61:1.1.1.p58. The markdown here is a longer paragraph. Scanning through, I see \\\"Пончик\\\" appears in the middle. The exact sentence is \\\"Поскольку моё тело совсем ничего не весило...\\\" Wait, no, the user is looking for Пончик, which is a character from a story. Let me check again. Oh, wait, in the paragraph, there's a mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the context of the body losing weight. Wait, no, maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the paragraph again carefully. \\n\\nThe paragraph starts with Знайка talking about his body losing weight and how he could float. Then it mentions that the water in the bottle didn't spill, and if you tipped the bottle, the water formed balls. But I don't see the word Пончик here. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. Oh, wait, the user's task is to find the first mention of Пончик. But in the given batch items, none of the markdowns contain Пончик. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", which might be from a previous batch, but the current batch doesn't have that pointer. \\n\\nWait, the current batch items are 60:1.1.1.p57, 61:1.1.1.p58, and 62:1.1.1.p59. None of these have Пончик. The user's task is to find the first mention, but in the current batch, there's no occurrence. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the current batch doesn't contain the required evidence. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 1, but since the current batch doesn't have any new evidence, the newEvidence array remains empty. So the output should be \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1026,\"completion_tokens\":533,\"total_tokens\":1559}}\n",
