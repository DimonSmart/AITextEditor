The user is asking for the second mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the book, excluding headers. First, I need to create a cursor to search for mentions of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" throughout the document. I'll start by using the mcp-create_cursor function with the appropriate description and name.\\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, I'll run the agent to iterate through the document. The first mention is found at pointer 24:1.1.1.p21. Since the user wants the second mention, I need to continue iterating. The next pointer is 25:1.1.1.p22, which is the second mention. I should check if this is the correct one and ensure it's not a header. The excerpt here talks about Professor Zvezdokhin's dissatisfaction, so it's a valid mention. \\n\\nI need to confirm that there are no other mentions between the first and second. The subsequent pointers (26, 28, 35, etc.) don't mention Professor Zvezdokhin again until the second one. Therefore, the second mention is at pointer 25:1.1.1.p22. I'll return this pointer and the corresponding excerpt in Russian, making sure to exclude any headers and provide the correct semantic pointer.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_dgtnyqyn\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":10739,\"completion_tokens\":310,\"total_tokens\":11049}}\n",
