The user wants the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item's markdown content to find any occurrence of that term.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer 12:1.1.1.p9, the markdown talks about the Moon's surface and bubbles, but I don't see \\\"Пончик\\\" here. The next item, 13:1.1.1.p10, mentions astronomers laughing at Znayka's theory, still no match. The third item, 14:1.1.1.p11, starts with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\", which is about volcanologists, but again, no \\\"Пончик\\\".\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first item's paragraph mentions \\\"Пончик\\\" in the context of Znayka's book. Wait, no, the first paragraph talks about the Moon's surface and bubbles, but the user's snapshot shows that the previous evidence was at 6:1.1.1.p3, which isn't in the current batch. The current batch items don't have \\\"Пончик\\\" in their markdown. So there's no new evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the current batch doesn't contain the term. But wait, the task says to find the first mention, and the snapshot's evidenceCount is 1, but the current batch doesn't have any new mentions. Therefore, the answer is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1085,\"completion_tokens\":342,\"total_tokens\":1427}}\n",
