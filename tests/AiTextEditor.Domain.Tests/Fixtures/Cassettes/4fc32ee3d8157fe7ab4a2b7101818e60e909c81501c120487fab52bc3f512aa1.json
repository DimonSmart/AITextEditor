The task is to find a paragraph where Ponchik chooses a darker night and drowns his old costumes in the Ogurcovna River. First, I need to scan through the current batch's items. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, but the pointer is 6:1.1.1.p3, which isn't in the current batch's items. The current batch starts from pointer 12:1.1.1.p9 onwards.\\n\\nLooking at each item's markdown content. The paragraphs here are all about Znayka's theories about the Moon's surface and the lunar craters. There's mention of volcanoes, meteorites, and even lunar inhabitants called \\\"lunatiks.\\\" But nowhere do I see any reference to Ponchik, a darker night, or the Ogurcovna River. The Ogurcovna River isn't mentioned at all in these paragraphs. Ponchik isn't a character here; the story seems to be about Znayka and the lunar theories. \\n\\nSince the task is about Ponchik and the Ogurcovna River, and none of the current batch's items mention these elements, there's no relevant evidence here. The user might have intended to include this information in a subsequent batch, but based on the provided data, there's nothing matching the task. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required evidence isn't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2002,\"completion_tokens\":322,\"total_tokens\":2324}}\n",
