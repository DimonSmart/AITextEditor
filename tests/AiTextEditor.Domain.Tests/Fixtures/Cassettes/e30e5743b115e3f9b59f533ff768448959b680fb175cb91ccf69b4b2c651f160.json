The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided the first batch of items. Let me look through the items.\\n\\nThe only item in the first batch has a pointer \\\"11:1.1.1.p8\\\" and the markdown content talks about Znayka and his theory about lunar craters. It mentions Znayka observing the Moon with Steklyashkin, but there's no mention of Professor Zvezdokhin here. The paragraph discusses Znayka's theory related to pancakes, but the professor's name isn't in the text. \\n\\nSince the context is null and the first batch doesn't have any evidence, the evidenceCount remains 0. The decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there might be more batches to check. The user mentioned that the firstBatch is false, so there are previous batches, but since the evidenceCount is 0 and the current batch doesn't have any matches, we need to keep scanning. The decision can't be \\\"done\\\" because the correct answer isn't determined yet. Also, since hasMore is true, there are more batches to process. Therefore, the correct decision is \\\"continue\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":716,\"completion_tokens\":278,\"total_tokens\":994}}\n",
