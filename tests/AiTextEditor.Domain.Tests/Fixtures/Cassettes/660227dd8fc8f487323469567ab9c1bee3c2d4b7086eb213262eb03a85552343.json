The user wants me to process portion index 14 and search for \u0027\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027 in each portion. If found, return the semantic pointer of the containing text segment.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check the given portion. The portion provided is a paragraph that starts with \\\u0022\u041F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D \u0438 \u043F\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043B\u043E\u0436\u0438\u043B...\\\u0022 and continues. The pointer information includes the HeadingTitle, LineIndex, CharacterOffset, etc. \\n\\nLooking at the text, the exact phrase \u0027\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027 is present. Wait, the text uses \u0027\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027 with a soft sign, but the search term is \u0027\u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027 without it. However, in Cyrillic, sometimes the soft sign can be omitted in certain contexts, but here it\u0027s part of the name. Wait, the user\u0027s query is to search for \u0027\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027, but the text has \u0027\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027. Are these considered the same? The soft sign (\u0451) is different from the letter \u0027\u0435\u0027 (\u0435). So \u0027\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027 is with the soft sign, while the search term is \u0027\u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027 without it. That might be a typo or a variation. But since the user specified \u0027\u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027, I need to check if that exact string exists in the text.\\n\\nLooking at the text: \\\u0022\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D \u0438 \u043F\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043B\u043E\u0436\u0438\u043B...\\\u0022 So the name is written as \u0027\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027.

In Russian, \u0027\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027 is the correct spelling with the soft sign, while \u0027\u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027 would be incorrect. However, maybe the user made a typo. But the task is to search exactly for \u0027\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027. Since the text has \u0027\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027, the exact match isn\u0027t found. Wait, but maybe the user intended the soft sign and it\u0027s a typo. Alternatively, maybe the text has a different spelling. Let me check again.\\n\\nThe text says: \\\u0022\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D \u0438 \u043F\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043B\u043E\u0436\u0438\u043B...\\\u0022 So the name is \u0027\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027.

Therefore, the search term isn\u0027t found. But wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the search term. However, the task is to look for the exact string. So in this case, the answer would be that the term isn\u0027t found. But wait, the user might have intended the soft sign. Alternatively, maybe the text has a different spelling. Let me check again. The text is in Cyrillic, and the name is written as \u0027\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027, which includes the soft sign.

Hence, the result would be that the term isn\u0027t found. But wait, maybe the user\u0027s search term is a typo, and they meant \u0027\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027.
