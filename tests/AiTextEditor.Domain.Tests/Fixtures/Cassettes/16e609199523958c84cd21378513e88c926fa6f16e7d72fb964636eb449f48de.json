The goal is to find the first direct dialogue between two named characters. The user provided a batch with one item, which is a paragraph from a story. The paragraph mentions several characters like Клёпки (Klepkis) and talks about the construction of a factory, but I need to check if there's any direct dialogue here.\\n\\nLooking at the markdown content: It describes the activities of the characters, like the residents helping build factories and the factory producing clothes. However, there's no direct speech. The sentences are all in third person, explaining what happened without any quotes or dialogue tags. \\n\\nThe task specifies that the dialogue must be between two named characters. Since the paragraph doesn't have any direct quotes or conversations, there's no evidence here. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and the recentEvidencePointers are empty. Since the current batch doesn't have any dialogue, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 1, but since there's no valid evidence, we can't set it to done. So the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":903,\"completion_tokens\":252,\"total_tokens\":1155}}\n",
