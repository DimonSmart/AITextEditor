Need evidence for each paragraph containing a person. We have three items in batch: two Paragraphs with Russian text; and a Heading. We must scan only current batch. We need to see if paragraphs contain any person mention. The first paragraph: \\\"– На этом заседание объявляю закрытым.\\\" Means \\\"I declare this meeting closed.\\\" No explicit person mention. Could be speaker, but not a name. Probably no character mention. Second: \\\"После чего встал и тоже пошёл домой.\\\" Means \\\"After that (someone) stood up and also went home.\\\" No explicit person name. So no character mentions. Heading is not paragraph, ignored. So no new evidence. batchFound false. action continue (since need more batches). needMoreContext false. progress maybe empty. newEvidence empty array.\\n\\nWe must not include pointers that are already in recentEvidencePointers; we have none new anyway.\\n\\nThus JSON: action \\\"continue\\\", batchFound false, newEvidence [], progress \\\"\\\", needMoreContext false.\\n\\nReturn exactly JSON object, no extra.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":881,\"completion_tokens\":269,\"total_tokens\":1150}}\n",
