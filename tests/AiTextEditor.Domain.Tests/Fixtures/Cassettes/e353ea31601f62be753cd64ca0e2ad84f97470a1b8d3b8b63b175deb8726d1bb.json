The user wants the first direct dialogue with two named characters in the same sentence. The context mentions examples like 'Alice says to Bob: Hello' or 'John: Hi, Mary!'. So I need to look for direct speech where two named characters are mentioned in the same sentence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, there's only one item with pointer \\\"3:1.1.1\\\" and it's a heading: \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". The heading translates to \\\"How Znayka Defeated Professor Zvezdokhin\\\". But this is a heading, not a paragraph or a dialogue. The task specifies to focus on paragraphs with direct dialogue. Since the item here is a heading, it's likely not containing the required dialogue. \\n\\nThe snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty. The user's instruction says to use only the current batch's content. Since there are no items that are paragraphs or list items with dialogue, there's no evidence to report. Also, the heading doesn't include any dialogue. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no matching evidence in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":652,\"completion_tokens\":270,\"total_tokens\":922}}\n",
