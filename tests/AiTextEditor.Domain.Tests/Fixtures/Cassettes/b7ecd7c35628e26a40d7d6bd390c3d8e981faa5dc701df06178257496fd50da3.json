The goal is to find the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The context mentions paragraphs with dialogue markers involving Znayka and the professor. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so no previous matches. The batch has three items. Let's check each one.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (12:1.1.1.p9), it talks about Znayka's book discussing the Moon's surface. However, there's no mention of the professor or sarcasm here. The second paragraph (13:1.1.1.p10) states that astronomers laughed at Znayka's theory. The word \\\"смеялись\\\" means laughed, which could imply sarcasm, but it's not directly a comment on the professor being stuck. The third paragraph (14:1.1.1.p11) starts with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\", which is the beginning of a dialogue, but it's cut off. \\n\\nWait, the task specifies that the comment should be sarcastic and about the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The second paragraph mentions astronomers laughing at Znayka's theory, but it doesn't mention the professor. The first paragraph mentions Znayka's theory about the Moon's surface, but again, no professor reference. The third paragraph is a dialogue starter but incomplete. \\n\\nSince the task requires a sarcastic comment from Znayka about the professor being stuck, none of the provided excerpts directly mention that. The second paragraph's laughter might be sarcastic, but it's not explicitly about the professor. Therefore, there's no matching evidence in the current batch. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" as there's no relevant excerpt.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1096,\"completion_tokens\":405,\"total_tokens\":1501}}\n",
