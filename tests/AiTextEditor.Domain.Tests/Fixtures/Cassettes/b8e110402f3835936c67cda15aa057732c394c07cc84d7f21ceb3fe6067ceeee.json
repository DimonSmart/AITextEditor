The user wants the first mentions of Фуксия and Селедочка. The task says to find the first occurrences in the provided batch. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence, with the pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\". But the current batch items don't include that pointer. The items here are 15:1.1.1.p12, 16:1.1.1.p13, and 17:1.1.1.p14. \\n\\nLooking at each paragraph's markdown content:\\n\\n1. The first paragraph mentions nothing about Фуксия or Селедочка. It's about lunar craters and volcanoes.\\n2. The second paragraph also doesn't have either name. It's discussing volcanoes on the moon.\\n3. The third paragraph starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\", which translates to \\\"Meteorites said...\\\", but there's no mention of the names here either.\\n\\nSince none of the current batch items contain Фуксия or Селедочка, there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required mentions aren't present in the current batch. The user might need to check subsequent batches or confirm if the names are in the provided data. But based on the given information, there's no match here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":812,\"completion_tokens\":306,\"total_tokens\":1118}}\n",
