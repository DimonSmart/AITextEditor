The user is asking about a specific description in a book: two rotating buildings on Kolokolchikov Street with a spiral descent and a devil's wheel on the roof. First, I need to figure out how to locate this information using the provided tools.\\n\\nThe user mentioned using a cursor to search for the exact location. The previous assistant created a cursor with a filter combining several keywords. The response from the tool was \\\"search_cursor,\\\" which might indicate that the cursor was successfully created. Now, the next step is to run the agent with this cursor to find the relevant paragraph.\\n\\nI should call the agent-run_agent function with the cursor name \\\"search_cursor\\\" and a task description that matches the user's query. The agent will process the document in portions, checking each part against the filter. Since the filter is a combination of keywords, the agent should find the paragraph that includes all these elements.\\n\\nWait, the user might need to check if the cursor found the exact mention. If the agent returns \\\"Status: More items available,\\\" it means there's more text to process. But since the query is specific, it's likely that the first portion contains the answer. However, to be thorough, I should continue running the agent until it either finds the answer or confirms there are no more items.\\n\\nAlso, I need to ensure that the answer is in Russian and includes the semantic pointer if applicable. The final answer should be concise, pointing out the exact paragraph where the description is found. Let me structure the response accordingly once the agent provides the evidence.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_re5pjo8c\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the paragraph describing two rotating buildings on Kolokolchikov Street with a spiral descent and a devil's wheel on the roof\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1046,\"completion_tokens\":381,\"total_tokens\":1427}}\n",
