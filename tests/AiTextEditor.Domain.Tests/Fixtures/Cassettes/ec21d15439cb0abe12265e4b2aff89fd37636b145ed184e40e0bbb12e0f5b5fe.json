The task is to check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different. Then return the names and the dialogue text.\\n\\nFirst, I need to look at the current batch items. The batch has three items:\\n\\n1. Pointer \\\"81:1.1.1.p78\\\", type Paragraph, markdown: \\\"– На этом заседание объявляю закрытым.\\\"\\n2. Pointer \\\"82:1.1.1.p79\\\", type Paragraph, markdown: \\\"После чего встал и тоже пошёл домой.\\\"\\n3. Pointer \\\"83:1.2\\\", type Heading, markdown: \\\"## Глава вторая\\\"\\n\\nThe task is looking for consecutive paragraphs starting with a character's name followed by a colon or similar. Let's check each paragraph.\\n\\nFirst paragraph: starts with \\\"– На этом заседание объявляю закрытым.\\\" The dash might be a bullet point or a dash, but there's no colon. The text starts with a dash, then \\\"На этом...\\\" which is Russian for \\\"This meeting is closed.\\\" So the first part is a dash, not a name followed by colon. So this doesn't match.\\n\\nSecond paragraph: \\\"После чего встал и тоже пошёл домой.\\\" Starts with \\\"После чего...\\\" which means \\\"After that...\\\" No colon, no name at the start. So this also doesn't match.\\n\\nThird item is a heading: \\\"## Глава вторая\\\" which is a heading, not a paragraph. The task says to ignore headings unless specified, and the context says to prefer Paragraph/ListItem content. So this heading is irrelevant.\\n\\nSo none of the current batch items have paragraphs starting with a character's name followed by a colon. Therefore, there's no evidence to extract here.\\n\\nThe snapshot has evidenceCount 0 and recentEvidencePointers empty. The task's maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't have a max to check. But since there's no matches, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), but wait, the current batch has no evidence. However, the decision is based on whether we found new evidence. Since there's no new evidence, newEvidence array is empty. But the decision rules: if we have found enough evidence (but max is null, so maybe not applicable), but the main thing is if there's any new evidence. If there's none, then decision should be \\\"continue\\\" if there are more batches, or \\\"done\\\" if no more batches. Wait, the output schema says decision can be \\\"continue\\\", \\\"done\\\", or \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\\nWait, the rules say: if maxEvidenceCount is provided and snapshot.evidenceCount + newEvidence.length \\u003e= max, then decision=\\\"done\\\". But here max is null, so that condition doesn't apply. Also, if there's no new evidence and there are more batches, then decision should be \\\"continue\\\". If there's no new evidence and no more batches, then \\\"done\\\" or \\\"not_found\\\"? But the task says \\\"not_found\\\" might be when no evidence found at all. Wait, the decision options: \\\"continue\\\" if there are more batches and we need to check next batch, \\\"done\\\" if we have enough evidence (but max is null, so maybe not), or \\\"not_found\\\" if no evidence found and no more batches? But the problem is, the current batch has no evidence, but hasMoreBatches is true. So the correct decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches to check. But the newEvidence array is empty. So the JSON would have decision \\\"continue\\\" and newEvidence empty.\\n\\nWait, but the rules say: \\\"Do NOT add evidence for a pointer that appears in snapshot.recentEvidencePointers.\\\" But in this case, recentEvidencePointers is empty, so no issue. But since there's no matches in current batch, newEvidence is empty.\\n\\nSo the output should be:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\",\\n  \\\"newEvidence\\\": []\\n}\\n\\nBecause there's no new evidence found in this batch, but there are more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), so we need to continue scanning next batches. The \\\"not_found\\\" decision might be when there's no evidence and no more batches, but here hasMoreBatches is true, so \\\"continue\\\" is correct.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":704,\"completion_tokens\":946,\"total_tokens\":1650}}\n",
