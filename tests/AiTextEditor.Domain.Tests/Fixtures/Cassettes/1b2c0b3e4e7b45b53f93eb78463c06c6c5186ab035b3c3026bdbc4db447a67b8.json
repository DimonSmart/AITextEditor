The user is asking where in the document it's described how astronomers in the Solar City got into a fight and split into volcanologists and meteoritologists.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out the right approach. The user mentioned \\\"Солнечном городе,\\\" which translates to \\\"Solar City.\\\" So, I should look for mentions of Solar City and the conflict between the two groups. \\n\\nSince the user is asking about a specific event, I should create a cursor to search for relevant paragraphs. The cursor needs a filter that includes terms like \\\"Солнечный город,\\\" \\\"астрономы,\\\" \\\"ссорились,\\\" \\\"разделились,\\\" \\\"вулканисты,\\\" and \\\"метеоритчики.\\\" But the cursor's filter must be stateless, so I can't use counters or track occurrences. Instead, I'll use a broad filter that includes all these keywords. \\n\\nWait, the user might be referring to a specific section where this split is discussed. Maybe the conflict is mentioned in a dialogue or a narrative section. Since dialogue often spans multiple paragraphs, I should ensure the cursor includes all paragraphs with dialogue markers. \\n\\nI'll start by creating a cursor named \\\"search_cursor\\\" with a filter description that looks for any mention of Solar City and the conflict terms. Then, I'll run the agent to find the first occurrence. If the first result doesn't have all the details, I'll need to continue scanning the document using the same cursor. \\n\\nAlso, I need to check if the answer is in the first batch or if it's in a later portion. The agent might return \\\"not_found\\\" but with \\\"CursorComplete\\\": false, meaning more data is available. So, I'll have to keep running the agent until I find the relevant paragraph or the cursor is complete. \\n\\nOnce I find the relevant paragraph, I'll note the pointerLabel and include it in the summary. If the document doesn't have this information, I'll inform the user it's not found.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_ocstny90\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"All paragraphs mentioning 'Солнечный город' and terms like 'ссорились', 'разделились', 'вулканисты', 'метеоритчики'\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1294,\"completion_tokens\":499,\"total_tokens\":1793}}\n",
