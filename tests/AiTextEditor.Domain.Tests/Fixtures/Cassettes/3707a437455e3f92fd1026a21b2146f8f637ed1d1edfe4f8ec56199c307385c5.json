The user wants me to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the document. First, I need to check each item in the current batch. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence with pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch's items start from pointer \\\"24:1.1.1.p21\\\" onwards.\\n\\nLooking through each paragraph's markdown content:\\n\\n- The first item (p21) talks about Знайкина книжка and mentions Звёздочкин, but no Фуксии.\\n- p22 mentions Звёздочкин again and the academy, still no match.\\n- p23 and p24 are about the professor entering and opening the discussion. No Фуксии here.\\n- p25 has the professor starting his report, but again, no mention.\\n- p26 to p35 involve the debate between Знайка and Звёздочкин. The terms used are Знайка, Звёздочкин, and some scientific terms, but nothing about Фуксии.\\n- p36 mentions \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the context of comparing the bottle to a planet. Wait, let me check again. Wait, in p36, the markdown says: \\\"– Почему же не научно? – авторитетно ответил Знайка. – Когда бутылка свободно перемещается в межпланетном пространстве, она находится в состоянии невесомости и во всём уподобляется планете. Внутри её всё будет происходить так же, как внутри планеты, то есть внутри Луны, в том случае, конечно, если Луна изнутри пустая.\\\" Hmm, no Фуксии here. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check all again.\\n\\nWait, maybe there's a mention in another paragraph. Let me go through each one again carefully. The user is looking for \\\"Фуксии\\\", which is a Russian word. Let me check each markdown for that exact term. \\n\\nLooking at p36 again: the text mentions \\\"планеты\\\" and \\\"Луны\\\", but not Фуксии. Wait, maybe there's a typo or a different spelling? Or perhaps it's in a different paragraph. Let me check all the markdowns again. \\n\\nWait, the initial snapshot had a pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\" which is from a previous batch. The current batch's items don't include that pointer. So in the current batch, none of the markdowns mention \\\"Фуксии\\\". Therefore, there are no new evidences to add. The decision should be \\\"continue\\\" since there's no new matches. But wait, the user's task says to find all mentions, and if none are found in the current batch, then the answer is \\\"not_found\\\" or \\\"continue\\\". Since the task allows up to 100, but the current batch has none, the decision would be \\\"continue\\\" with no new evidence. However, the user's instruction says to output exactly one JSON object. So the correct response is to have \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\" and an empty \\\"newEvidence\\\" array. But wait, the rules say to report all matches found in the batch. If there are none, then newEvidence is empty. So the final JSON would have decision as \\\"continue\\\" and newEvidence as an empty array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2406,\"completion_tokens\":762,\"total_tokens\":3168}}\n",
