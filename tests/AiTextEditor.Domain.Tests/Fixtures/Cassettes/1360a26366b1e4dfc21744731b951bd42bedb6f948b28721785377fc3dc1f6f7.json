The user wants to find a mention of Znayka spending about four hours on the Moon and returning due to air problems. The context is a lunar expedition study.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan the current batch's items. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, but the user is asking for new evidence. The recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", which I should avoid.\\n\\nLooking through the provided items, the paragraphs from 74 to 86. Let me check each one. The first few paragraphs talk about Zvezdochkin and some commotion, but not Znayka. Then there's a mention of Znayka in paragraph 85:1.2.1.p1. Wait, the pointer here is 85:1.2.1.p1. The excerpt says that the newspaper report mentioned Znayka's book and the discussion about the Moon. But does it mention the four hours or air issues?\\n\\nWait, the user's task is about Znayka's time on the Moon and returning due to air problems. Let me check the excerpts again. The paragraph 85 mentions the report about Znayka's book and the discussion, but not the specific details about his time or air issues. The next paragraph, 86, is truncated, so maybe there's more info there, but the provided text ends. \\n\\nLooking through all the items again, none of the paragraphs mention Znayka's time on the Moon or air problems. The existing evidence pointer 8:1.1.1.p5 might be from a previous batch, but in the current batch, there's no mention of the required details. Therefore, there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the current batch doesn't contain the required information.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1504,\"completion_tokens\":409,\"total_tokens\":1913}}\n",
