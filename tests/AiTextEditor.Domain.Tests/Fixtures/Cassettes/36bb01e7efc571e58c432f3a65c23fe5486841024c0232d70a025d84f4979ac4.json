I created a cursor for all paragraphs to make sure I don't miss any. Now I need to run the agent to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nFirst, I'll use the agent to scan through the cursor. The task is to find the first dialogue where two characters are named. The agent will process the paragraphs in batches. Since dialogues can span multiple paragraphs, I have to check each paragraph carefully.\\n\\nI'll start by running the agent with the dialogue_cursor. The first batch might contain the answer, but if not, I'll have to keep running it until I find the right paragraph. I need to look for direct speech with character names mentioned. If the first mention is in the first batch, that's great. If not, continue until the cursor completes or the answer is found.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_br4d2rb0\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"dialogue_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first dialogue between two named characters\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1462,\"completion_tokens\":214,\"total_tokens\":1676}}\n",
