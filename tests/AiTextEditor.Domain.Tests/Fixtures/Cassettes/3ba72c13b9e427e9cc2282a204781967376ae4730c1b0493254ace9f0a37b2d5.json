The user wants to find a description of two rotating buildings on Kolokolchikov Street with a spiral descent and a devil's wheel on the roof. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, pointer 4:1.1.1.p1, but I can't use that since it's in the recentEvidencePointers.\\n\\nLooking at the current batch items, I need to scan through each paragraph. The task mentions specific elements: two rotating buildings, spiral descent, and a devil's wheel on the roof. Let me check each entry.\\n\\nStarting with pointer 23:1.1.1.p20. It talks about lunar inhabitants and their movement inside the Moon. No mention of buildings or Kolokolchikov Street. Next, pointer 24:1.1.1.p21 discusses a book and Professor Zvezdochkin's criticism. Not relevant. Pointer 25:1.1.1.p22 is about the academy discussing the book. Still not related. \\n\\nPointer 26:1.1.1.p23 mentions a lecture hall and the professor's speech. No buildings here. Pointer 27:1.1.1.p24 is the professor opening the meeting. Not helpful. \\n\\nPointer 28:1.1.1.p25 has the professor's lecture. He talks about the Moon's interior and gravity, but no buildings. Pointer 29:1.1.1.p26 is Znayka's response. Still no. \\n\\nPointer 30:1.1.1.p27 is a back-and-forth between Znayka and the professor. No. Pointer 31:1.1.1.p28 mentions Znayka's experience in a rocket. Not related. \\n\\nPointer 32:1.1.1.p29 talks about the professor's reaction. Still nothing. Pointer 33:1.1.1.p30 is about the water in the bottle. Wait, here's a mention of a bottle and water behavior, but that's about physics, not buildings. \\n\\nPointer 34:1.1.1.p31 describes the water in the bottle during weightlessness. The water spreads evenly, which relates to gravity but not the buildings. \\n\\nPointer 35:1.1.1.p32 is the professor's sarcastic comment about comparing the bottle to a planet. Still no mention of buildings, streets, or the required elements. \\n\\nNone of the paragraphs in the current batch mention Kolokolchikov Street, rotating buildings, spiral descent, or a devil's wheel. The existing evidence was from a previous batch, and the current batch doesn't have any relevant content. So, the decision should be 'not_found' since there's no new evidence in the current batch that matches the task.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2223,\"completion_tokens\":623,\"total_tokens\":2846}}\n",
