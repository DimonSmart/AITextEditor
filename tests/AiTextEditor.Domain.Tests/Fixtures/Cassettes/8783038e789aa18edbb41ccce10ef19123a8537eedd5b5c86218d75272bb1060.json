Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to find all instances where Professor Zvezdokhin is mentioned. Since the user wants the second occurrence, I should start by locating the first mention. Then, continue searching for the next one.\\n\\nI'll start by creating a cursor to search for the first mention. Using the mcp-create_cursor function with the description \\\"Mentions of Professor Zvezdokhin\\\" and a name like \\\"search_cursor\\\". Then, run the agent to find the first occurrence. Once I have the first mention, I'll need to continue the search from there to find the second one. \\n\\nWait, the user said to exclude headers, so when the agent finds a match, it should return the paragraph, not the heading. I need to make sure that the cursor is set up to look for the actual text mentions, not just headings. \\n\\nAfter finding the first mention, I'll have to run the agent again, possibly starting after the pointer of the first mention to get the next one. The mcp-run_agent function can be used again with the same cursor but a task description to find the next occurrence. \\n\\nI should check the evidence items returned by each run. The first item might contain multiple mentions, so I need to count each mention within the paragraphs. If the first mention is in the first paragraph, the second could be in the same or a subsequent one. \\n\\nAlso, I need to keep track of the pointers to ensure I'm not missing any. If the first run gives me the first mention, the next run starting after that pointer should give the second. If not, I might need to iterate further. \\n\\nLet me structure the steps: create the cursor, run the agent for the first mention, note the pointer, then run again starting after that pointer to find the second. If the second mention is in the same paragraph as the first, I'll have to check the text again. \\n\\nI should also remember to use the mcp-list_pointers or mcp-show_user_message if needed, but the main tools here are creating and running the cursor. Once found, the answer should include the semantic pointer pointing to the relevant paragraph.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_cmta3j31\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"description\\\":\\\"Mentions of профессора Звёздочкина (исключая заголовки)\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":883,\"completion_tokens\":519,\"total_tokens\":1402}}\n",
