The user is asking for the third mention of Professor Zvezdochkin in the book, excluding headers. \\n\\nFirst, I need to create a keyword cursor to find all instances of \\\"профессор\\\" and \\\"звёздочкин\\\". The previous step already did that, so the cursor is set up. Then, reading the first batch gave me three items. The first item is a header, so we skip that. The next two paragraphs mention Professor Zvezdochkin. But the user wants the third mention. \\n\\nLooking at the items returned, the first batch has the header (3:1.1.1) and then two paragraphs (24:1.1.1.p21 and 25:1.1.1.p22). The second paragraph (25:1.1.1.p22) is the second mention. The third mention might be in the next batch. Since the HasMore flag is true, there are more items to read. \\n\\nSo, the next step is to read the next batch using the same cursor. The nextAfterPointer is \\\"25:1.1.1.p22\\\", so the next batch will start after that. If there's another mention in the subsequent paragraphs, that would be the third one. If not, maybe the third mention is in a later part of the document. \\n\\nI need to check the next batch to find the third mention. If there's no more, then the answer would be that there's no third mention. But according to the plan, the user's step limit is 128, and the current step is 4 with stop reason pending. So, I should proceed to read the next batch to find the third occurrence.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_zs5uwxel\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"chat_cursor_tools-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1759,\"completion_tokens\":398,\"total_tokens\":2157}}\n",
