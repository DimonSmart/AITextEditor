Единственным, кто пострадал на этом деле, оказался Пончик. Когда Пончик увидел, что теперь можно брать в магазине любую вещь, какая только могла понадобиться, он стал недоумевать: к чему ему вся та куча костюмов, которая накопилась у него дома. Все эти костюмы к тому же вышли из моды, и их всё равно нельзя было носить. Выбрав потемней ночку, Пончик завязал свои старые костюмы в огромный узел, вынес тайком из дома и утопил в Огурцовой реке, а вместо них натаскал себе из магазинов новых костюмов. Кончилось тем, что его комната превратилась в какой-то склад готового платья. Костюмы лежали у него и в шкафу, и на шкафу, и на столе, и под столом, и на книжных полках, висели на стенах, на спинках стульев и даже под потолком, на верёвочках.\\\",\\\"reason\\\":\\\"Пончик утопил старые костюмы в Огурцовой реке после того, как они вышли из моды.\\\"}]}\",\"reasoning\":\"Okay, let's tackle this task. The goal is to find the first mention of Ponchik throwing old costumes into the Ogurcovna River. The context is all paragraphs mentioning Ponchik and the Ogurcovna River. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. There are two paragraphs here. Let's look at the first one, pointer 6:1.1.1.p3. The markdown mentions that Ponchik tied his old costumes into a big knot, took them out secretly, and dumped them into the Ogurcovna River. That seems to directly match the task. \\n\\nThe second paragraph, pointer 7:1.1.1.p4, talks about the moths and the smell, but doesn't mention throwing costumes into the river. So the first paragraph is the relevant one. \\n\\nSince the task asks for the first mention, and the evidence count from the snapshot is 0, this should be the first piece of evidence. The reason is that it describes Ponchik disposing of his old costumes in the specified river. I need to make sure the pointer and excerpt are exact as per the batch. No other pointers are in the recentEvidencePointers, so this is a new evidence. The decision here is to continue since the maxEvidenceCount is null, but maybe if there's more batches, but since hasMoreBatches is true, but the user might want all possible evidence. However, since the task is to find the first mention, once found, maybe decision is done? Wait, the maxEvidenceCount is null, so maybe we need to collect all possible. But the user's instruction says to report all matches. However, the task says \\\"first mention,\\\" so perhaps once found, decision is done. Wait, the rules say if maxEvidenceCount is provided and the count meets it, set decision to done. But here, maxEvidenceCount is null, so maybe we should continue. But the user might want to stop after the first occurrence. Wait, the task says \\\"Find the first mention,\\\" so once found, the decision should be done. But according to the rules, the agent should report all matches. However, the task's goal is to find the first mention, so maybe once found, the decision is done. But the rules say to report all matches. Hmm. The user's instruction says to report all matches, but the task is to find the first. Maybe the agent should report the first occurrence and then decide done. But the rules state that if maxEvidenceCount is provided and the count meets it, set decision to done. Since maxEvidence, the user hasn't specified a max, so maybe continue. But the task is to find the first mention, so once found, the answer is done. However, the agent's job is to scan the current batch and extract candidates. So in this case, the first paragraph is the first mention, so the newEvidence includes that, and since it's the first, the decision would be done. Wait, but the rules say to report all matches in the current batch. So if there's another mention in the same batch, it should be included. But in this case, the first paragraph is the only one with the action. So the newEvidence would have that one, and since it's the first, the decision is done. But the user's task says \\\"first mention,\\\" so maybe the agent should stop after finding the first. However, the rules state that the agent should report all matches in the current batch. So even if it's the first, the agent should include it and decide based on whether there's a max. Since max is null, the decision is continue. Wait, the output schema's decision can be continue, done, or not_found. The rules say if maxEvidenceCount is provided and the count meets it, set to done. Since here max is null, the agent should continue. But the task is to find the first mention, so once found, maybe the agent should decide done. But according to the rules, the agent should report all matches in the current batch. So even if it's the first, the agent should include it and decide continue unless max is reached. Since max is null, the decision is continue. Therefore, the correct output is to include the first paragraph as newEvidence and set decision to continue. But the user might expect that once the first is found, the task is done. However, the agent's role is to scan the current batch and report all possible evidence, then decide based on max. Since max is not set, the decision is continue. So the answer should have the newEvidence with the first paragraph's pointer and excerpt, and decision continue.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1284,\"completion_tokens\":1313,\"total_tokens\":2597}}\n",
