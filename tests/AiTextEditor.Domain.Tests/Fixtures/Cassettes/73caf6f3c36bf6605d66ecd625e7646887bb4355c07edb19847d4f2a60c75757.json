The user wants me to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The task says to look for paragraphs with dialogue markers like quotes or dashes indicating direct speech. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once I find one, I should set decision to \\\"done\\\".\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, the items are all headings. The first item is a main heading, then a subheading, and another subheading. None of these seem to be paragraphs with dialogue. The headings don't have any quotes or dashes indicating direct speech. Since there are no items that match the criteria, I can't extract any evidence. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and there are no recent pointers. So, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no relevant content in the current batch. I need to output that in the JSON as specified.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":664,\"completion_tokens\":193,\"total_tokens\":857}}\n",
