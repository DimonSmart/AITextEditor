Let's try full scan cursor to get all items and then search manually. But that might be large. Instead, we can use filtered cursor with filterDescription that matches \\\"Глава 2\\\". But we need a stateless filter. We can use regex? The filterDescription likely expects a simple condition. Not sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, we can use cursor_create_full_scan_cursor to get all items, then read batches until we find the second chapter. But that might be large.
