The goal is to find the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The context is paragraphs with dialogue markers mentioning Znayka and Professor. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so no previous matches. The batch has three items. Let me check each one.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (21:1.1.1.p18): It talks about Znayka rejecting his theory after visiting the Moon and seeing a crater. He notices the ring mountain is actually ruins of a brick wall. No mention of the professor here, so probably not relevant.\\n\\nNext, the second paragraph (22:1.1.1.p19): Znayka reflects on the walls being made by intelligent beings and publishes a book about lunar beings. Still no professor mentioned. The third paragraph (23:1.1.1.p20) discusses lunar beings moving inside the Moon because the surface is too hot. Again, no professor here.\\n\\nWait, the task mentions a sarcastic comment from Znayka about the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. But none of the provided paragraphs mention the professor. The user might have intended to include a different batch, but based on the given data, there's no reference to the professor. Therefore, the answer should be 'not_found' since the required evidence isn't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1302,\"completion_tokens\":329,\"total_tokens\":1631}}\n",
