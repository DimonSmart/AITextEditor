The user is asking where Professor Zvezdochkin is first mentioned in the book, excluding headers. So I need to find the first occurrence of his name in the text.\\n\\nFirst, I used the keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor tool with the keyword \\\"звёздочкин\\\" to search for instances of his name. Then, I read the first batch of results using chat_cursor_tools-read_cursor_batch. The response included a heading and two paragraphs. \\n\\nThe first paragraph under the heading \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\" mentions Professor Zvezdochkin. But the user wants the first mention, so I need to check if there's an earlier occurrence. The next batch would start after the last pointer provided, which is \\\"25:1.1.1.p22\\\". However, since the user's goal is to find the first mention, and the first paragraph already includes his name, that's likely the answer. But to be thorough, I should check if there's a previous paragraph before the heading. However, the cursor's first batch might not have included everything before the heading. Wait, the first item is a heading, then the next items are paragraphs. The first paragraph after the heading is where the mention is. Since the user wants the first mention excluding headers, the first occurrence is in the first paragraph under the heading. But maybe there's an earlier mention in a different part of the document. However, the cursor's initial batch might not have covered all previous content. The next step would be to read the next batch to ensure there's no earlier mention. But according to the tool response, the first batch includes the heading and the first two paragraphs. The first paragraph after the heading is where the name is first used. Therefore, the answer is in that paragraph. The stop reason is no more batches, so the final answer is there.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1758,\"completion_tokens\":498,\"total_tokens\":2256}}\n",
