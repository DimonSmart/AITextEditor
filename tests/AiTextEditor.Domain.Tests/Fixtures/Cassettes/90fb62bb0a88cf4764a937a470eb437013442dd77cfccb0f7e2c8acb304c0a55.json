The user wants the first mention of Fuchs in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to find any reference to Fuchs. \\n\\nLooking at the first item, the paragraph talks about the Moon's surface and some theories, but I don't see any mention of Fuchs here. The second paragraph mentions astronomers and vulcanologists laughing at Znayka's theory, but again, no Fuchs. The third paragraph starts with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\" which translates to \\\"Vulcanologists said:\\\", but there's no Fuchs mentioned here either.\\n\\nSince none of the items in the current batch mention Fuchs, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The newEvidence array will be empty because there are no relevant pointers. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but that's from a previous batch, so it's not considered here. The user's task is to find the first mention, but since the current batch doesn't have it, the answer is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1080,\"completion_tokens\":244,\"total_tokens\":1324}}\n",
