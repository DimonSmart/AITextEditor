The user is asking in which paragraph Ponchik, choosing a darker night, drowned his old costumes in the Cucumber River. First, I need to figure out how to approach this.\\n\\nThe user mentioned \\\"Пончик,\\\" which I know is a character from a Russian children's book, \\\"Ponchik\\\" by Yuliy Petrovich Dyachenko. The story involves Ponchik, a little boy who loves to eat, and there's a part where he gets into a situation with a river. The question is about a specific scene where he drowns his old costumes in the Cucumber River during a dark night.\\n\\nSince the user is referring to a specific detail from the text, I need to use the provided tools to search the document. The tools include creating a cursor and running an agent to find the relevant paragraph. \\n\\nFirst, I should create a cursor to search for mentions related to Ponchik, the Cucumber River, and the action of drowning costumes. The filter description should look for these keywords. Then, using the agent, I'll run a task to find the first occurrence that matches these criteria. \\n\\nI need to make sure the task description is clear but not using exact quotes. The user's question mentions \\\"потемней ночку\\\" (darker night) and \\\"утопил старые костюмы\\\" (drowned old costumes). So the filter should look for these elements. \\n\\nI'll start by creating a cursor with the name \\\"search_cursor\\\" and a filter description that includes these keywords. Then, run the agent with this cursor, specifying the task to find the first mention. The maxEvidenceCount can be set to 1 to get the first occurrence. \\n\\nAfter retrieving the evidence, I'll check the paragraph to confirm if it matches the user's question. If it does, I'll note the pointer label and provide the answer in Russian. If not, I'll continue searching. \\n\\nI also need to remember to use the semantic pointer if applicable and ensure that the answer is based solely on the document content, not external knowledge. If the document doesn't have the information, I should inform the user accordingly.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_8qvzxszg\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"Mentions of Ponchik choosing a darker night and drowning old costumes in the Cucumber River\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1140,\"completion_tokens\":515,\"total_tokens\":1655}}\n",
