Let me think.\\n\\nWait, the user mentioned \\\"two named characters,\\\" so the dialogue should have both names mentioned. Maybe the previous cursors didn't check for that. Let me adjust the filter to look for paragraphs where both character names are present in the same paragraph, along with dialogue markers. That way, it's more targeted.\\n\\nI should create a new cursor with a filter that specifically looks for paragraphs containing direct speech and both character names. Let's try that. If I set the filter to \\\"All paragraphs with direct speech markers and at least two named characters,\\\" it might capture the needed dialogues. Then run the agent again to find the first occurrence. If it still doesn't find, maybe the document doesn't have such a dialogue, but I'll keep trying.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_40l7o3vn\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"All paragraphs with direct speech markers and at least two named characters\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":8388608,\\\"maxElements\\\":5000,\\\"name\\\":\\\"dialogue_cursor_v4\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1812,\"completion_tokens\":269,\"total_tokens\":2081}}\n",
