The user is asking about who Fuchsia and Selodka are and where they are first mentioned. First, I need to figure out how to approach this in the given tools.\\n\\nSince the user wants to know about characters, I should use the cursor-create_cursor function to create a filter that captures all paragraphs mentioning these names. The filter should look for any occurrence of \\\"Фуксия\\\" or \\\"Селедочка\\\". Using a broad filter like \\\"All paragraphs\\\" might miss some mentions, so maybe a more specific filter would be better. Wait, the instructions say for multi-paragraph concepts, use a very broad filter. So maybe \\\"All paragraphs\\\" is the way to go. But I need to make sure the filter is stateless and per-element.\\n\\nWait, the cursor-create_cursor function requires a filterDescription that's stateless. So I can set the filter to check if the paragraph contains either \\\"Фуксия\\\" or \\\"Селедочка\\\". That should work. Then, using agent-run_agent with that cursor to scan the document. Since the answer might be in the first portion or require multiple runs, I need to handle the \\\"Status: More items available\\\" case by repeating the run_agent with the same cursor.\\n\\nAlso, the user wants the first mention, so I should collect all occurrences and then determine the earliest one. But the tools don't have a way to sort by position, so I might need to process each result as it comes. Alternatively, the first occurrence found by the cursor might be the first mention. But I need to make sure to check all possible paragraphs.\\n\\nSo the steps are: create a cursor with filter for any paragraph containing Фуксия or Селедочка. Then run the agent, and collect all the paragraphs until the cursor is complete. Then analyze those paragraphs to find where they are first mentioned.\\n\\nWait, but the user might have multiple mentions, so I need to check each paragraph found by the cursor. The first occurrence in the document would be the first mention. But since the cursor reads in portions, the first result might not be the first occurrence. However, the agent-run_agent will process the document in portions, and if the cursor is created correctly, it should return all relevant paragraphs. Then, I can look through those paragraphs to find the first mention.\\n\\nSo, first, create the cursor with the filter. Then run the agent, and keep track of the paragraphs found. Once all are processed, check each paragraph for the first occurrence of either name. Then, the answer would be the first paragraph where either name is mentioned, and the characters are introduced there.\\n\\nI need to make sure that the filter is correctly set to capture any mention of these names. Also, since the user is asking for the first mention, I need to process all the paragraphs found by the cursor and determine which one is the earliest in the document. However, the cursor might not process the entire document in one go, so I need to keep running the agent until the cursor is complete. Then, collect all the paragraphs and find the earliest one.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the first occurrence is in the first portion processed by the cursor. But to be thorough, I should process all portions until the cursor is done. Then, among all the found paragraphs, determine which one is the first mention. That's the plan.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_kdg7bvkp\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"paragraph contains 'Фуксия' or 'Селедочка'\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"maxElements\\\":500,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":945,\"completion_tokens\":755,\"total_tokens\":1700}}\n",
