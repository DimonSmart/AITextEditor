The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions lines with dialogue markers or character names. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, the first item is a paragraph discussing the Moon's surface, no dialogue here. The second paragraph mentions astronomers laughing at Znayka's theory, but no dialogue between characters. The third paragraph starts with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\" which is a dialogue marker. But there's no second character mentioned yet. The next item might have the response, but since there's no next item provided, maybe this is the only one. However, the task requires a dialogue between two characters. Since the third item only has one side of the dialogue, maybe there's another item in the batch. Wait, the user provided only three items. The third item ends with \\\"говорили:\\\" which is a dialogue marker, but no actual dialogue. So maybe there's no dialogue here. The user might have more batches, but according to the input, this is the first batch. Since there's no actual dialogue between two characters in the provided items, the answer would be not_found. But wait, the third item starts with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\" which could be the start of a dialogue. If the next item is the response from another character, but since there's no next item, maybe it's not. So the answer is not_found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1088,\"completion_tokens\":326,\"total_tokens\":1414}}\n",
