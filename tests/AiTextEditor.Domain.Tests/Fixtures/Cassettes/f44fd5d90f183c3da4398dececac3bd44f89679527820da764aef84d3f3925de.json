Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search for mentions of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". The function mcp-create_cursor is the right tool here. I'll set the name to \\\"search_cursor\\\" and the description to \\\"Mentions of профессор Звёздочкин\\\". \\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, I should run the agent to find the first occurrence. Using mcp-run_agent with the cursor name and task description to locate the first mention. \\n\\nAfter getting the result, I need to check the evidence items. The first paragraph that contains the mention is the answer. I should make sure not to include any headers, so I'll look at the text content of the paragraph. \\n\\nIf the first result doesn't have the mention, I'll continue iterating by running the agent again until I find the correct paragraph. Once found, I'll note the pointer label and include it in the answer. \\n\\nAlso, I need to remember that the user wants the first mention, so I shouldn't stop until I confirm that this is the earliest occurrence. If the cursor completes without finding, I should inform the user it's not in the document. \\n\\nLet me start by creating the cursor.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_o0wzliy0\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"description\\\":\\\"Mentions of профессор Звёздочкин\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":884,\"completion_tokens\":324,\"total_tokens\":1208}}\n",
