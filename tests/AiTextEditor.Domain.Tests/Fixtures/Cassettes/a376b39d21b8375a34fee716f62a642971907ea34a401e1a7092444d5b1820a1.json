Я буду жаловаться! Я напишу в газету!

The task is to find the first mention of профессора Звёздочкина, excluding headers. The user provided a batch of items, and I need to scan through them.\\n\\nFirst, I'll check each item's pointer and markdown content. The snapshot shows that there are already 2 pieces of evidence, with pointers 24:1.1.1.p21 and 70:1.1.1.p67. But those aren't in the current batch, so I can ignore them.\\n\\nLooking at the current batch items:\\n\\n- Pointer 76:1.1.1.p73 mentions Звёздочкина being dragged out. That's a mention, but is it the first? The task says to exclude headers, and this is a paragraph. So this could be a candidate.\\n\\n- Pointer 79:1.1.1.p76 has \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" explicitly. Since the task is to find the first mention, I need to check if this is the earliest occurrence in the batch. The pointers are in order 76,77,78,79, etc. So 76 is earlier than 79. But wait, the user's snapshot has evidence pointers that might be from previous batches. However, the current batch's items start at 76. So the first mention in this batch is 76:1.1.1.p73, which mentions Звёздочкина. But the exact phrase \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" is in 79. So the first occurrence in the current batch where the full name is used is 79. But the task says \\\"first mention\\\", so maybe even if it's just the last name, but the task specifies \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" as the full mention. \\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"first mention of профессора Звёздочкина (исключая заголовки)\\\". So the exact phrase \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" is what's needed. Looking through the current batch:\\n\\n- 76:1.1.1.p73: \\\"Звёздочкина\\\" (last name only)\\n- 79:1.1.1.p76: \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" (full mention)\\n- 80:1.1.1.p77: \\\"Звёздочкина\\\" again\\n- 81:1.1.1.p78: \\\"Звёздочкина\\\" again\\n\\nSo the first occurrence of the full phrase \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" in the current batch is at 79. But the user's snapshot has previous evidence pointers, but since the current batch's items start at 76, which is after the snapshot's 24 and 70, those are from earlier batches. Therefore, in the current batch, the first mention of the full name is 79. However, the task says \\\"first mention\\\" overall, but the user is processing batches sequentially. Since the current batch is the first one being processed (firstBatch is false, but hasMoreBatches is false, so it's the last batch?), but the snapshot's evidenceCount is 2, which might be from previous batches. So in the current batch, the first mention of the full name is 79. Therefore, the new evidence should be 79:1.1.1.p76. The excerpt is the exact markdown content. The reason is that it directly mentions \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1402,\"completion_tokens\":870,\"total_tokens\":2272}}\n",
