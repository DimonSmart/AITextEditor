The user wants the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin being described as \\\"kipevший от негодования\\\" (boiling with anger) and a brief character description. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan the current batch items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so no previous matches. The batch has items starting from pointer 1:1 as headings, then paragraphs. \\n\\nLooking through the paragraphs, the task is in Russian, so I need to check for the exact phrase \\\"кипевший от негодования\\\". Let me go through each paragraph's markdown.\\n\\nPointer 4:1.1.1.p1 talks about the time since Nезнайка's trip and changes in the city. No mention of the professor here. \\n\\nPointer 5:1.1.1.p2 mentions the factory and machines, but no professor. \\n\\nPointer 6:1.1.1.p3 is about Ponчик and his clothes, still no professor. \\n\\nPointer 7:1.1.1.p4 describes Ponчик's situation with the smell, but again, no professor. \\n\\nWait, the headings mention \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\" (How Znayka defeated Professor Zvezdokhin) in pointer 3:1.1.1. But the actual content in the paragraphs doesn't mention the professor being angry. The paragraphs are about the city's changes and Ponчик's problems. \\n\\nHmm, maybe the professor is mentioned in another part. Let me check again. The user's task is to find the first occurrence where the professor is described as boiling with anger. Since the current batch's items don't have any mention of the professor in the paragraphs, perhaps the answer is that there's no evidence here. But the user's instruction says to output exactly one JSON. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each paragraph again. The first paragraph (4:1.1.1.p1) starts with \\\"С тех пор как Незнайка совершил путешествие...\\\" which is about Nезнайка's trip. The second paragraph (5:1.1.1.p2) talks about the factory. Third (6:1.1.1.p3) about Ponчик. Fourth (7:1.1.1.p4) about the smell. None mention Professor Zvezdokhin. \\n\\nSo, the answer would be \\\"not_found\\\" since there's no evidence in the current batch. But the user's task says to find the first mention. Since the current batch doesn't have it, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1908,\"completion_tokens\":571,\"total_tokens\":2479}}\n",
