The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that dialogues are indicated by markers like quotes or dashes. The user provided a batch with two paragraphs.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan each item in the batch for any direct speech between named characters. Let's look at the first paragraph (8:1.1.1.p5). The text talks about Znayka meeting Fuxiya and Selodka, but there's no dialogue here. It's all narrative.\\n\\nNow the second paragraph (9:1.1.1.p6) discusses Znayka's return and his stories, but again, no direct dialogue. The entire batch seems to be narrative without any quotes or dashes indicating spoken words between characters. \\n\\nSince there's no evidence of dialogue in either paragraph, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The newEvidence array remains empty. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and since we didn't find any new evidence, the decision is straightforward.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1312,\"completion_tokens\":227,\"total_tokens\":1539}}\n",
