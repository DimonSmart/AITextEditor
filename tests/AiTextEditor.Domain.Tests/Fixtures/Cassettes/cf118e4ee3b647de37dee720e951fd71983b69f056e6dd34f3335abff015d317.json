The user wants to find the first mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" in the text, excluding headers. The snapshot shows that there are zero evidence counts and no recent pointers, so we need to start from the beginning.\\n\\nLooking at the first batch items, each has a pointer and markdown content. Let me check each paragraph one by one. \\n\\nThe first item (8:1.1.1.p5) talks about Знайка and his trip to the Sun City, meeting scientists like Фуксия and Селёдочка. No mention of Звёздочкин here. \\n\\nThe second item (9:1.1.1.p6) mentions Стекляшкин, an astronomer, but again, no Звёздочкин. \\n\\nThird item (10:1.1.1.p7) discusses debates among astronomers about the origin of lunar craters. Still no sign of Звёздочкин. \\n\\nFourth item (11:1.1.1.p8) continues the story of Знайка and Стекляшкин observing the Moon. Wait, here's a mention of Стекляшкин, but not Звёздочкин. \\n\\nHmm, none of the paragraphs in the first batch mention профессор Звёздочкин. The task says to exclude headers, so maybe the headers aren't part of the content. Since all the items here are paragraphs, and none have the name, the answer would be that there's no evidence found in this batch. \\n\\nBut the user's instruction says to output either continue, done, or not_found. Since the first batch doesn't have the mention, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" to check subsequent batches. However, the input only provides the first batch. Wait, the input has \\\"hasMoreBatches\\\": true, so there are more batches coming. But the current batch doesn't have the evidence. Therefore, the correct decision here is \\\"continue\\\" because the evidence isn't found in the current batch, and we need to process more batches. \\n\\nWait, but the user's output schema requires \\\"decision\\\" to be one of the three. Since the current batch doesn't have the mention, and there are more batches, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\". However, if the task is to find the first mention, and the current batch doesn't have it, then the answer is \\\"not_found\\\" only if there's no possibility of it being in future batches. But since hasMoreBatches is true, we can't assume that. Therefore, the correct decision here is \\\"continue\\\" because we need to check the next batches. But the user's example might expect \\\"not_found\\\" if the current batch doesn't have it. Wait, the rules say to use only the current batch. Since the current batch doesn't have the mention, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\"? Or \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches? \\n\\nWait, the task is to find the first mention. If the current batch doesn't have it, but there are more batches, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" to process the next batches. However, the user's output example might have different logic. Let me recheck the rules. \\n\\nThe evidence rules state to use only the current batch. If the current batch doesn't have the mention, then the decision is \\\"not_found\\\" only if there are no more batches. But since hasMoreBatches is true, we can't conclude \\\"not_found\\\" yet. Therefore, the correct decision is \\\"continue\\\" to proceed to the next batches. However, the user's example might have different expectations. \\n\\nWait, the initial snapshot has evidenceCount 0, and the current batch doesn't have the mention. So the answer is \\\"not_found\\\" because the current batch doesn't have it, and the task is to find the first mention. But since there are more batches, maybe the answer is \\\"continue\\\". But according to the rules, the decision should be based on the current batch. If the current batch doesn't have the mention, then the answer is \\\"not_found\\\" only if there are no more batches. Since there are more batches, the decision is \\\"continue\\\". \\n\\nBut the user's output example might require \\\"not_found\\\" if the current batch doesn't have it. Wait, the user's instruction says: \\\"You MUST output exactly ONE JSON object and nothing else\\\". The decision can be \\\"continue\\\", \\\"done\\\", or \\\"not_found\\\". \\n\\nIn this case, since the current batch doesn't have the mention, and there are more batches, the correct decision is \\\"continue\\\". However, if the task is to find the first mention, and the current batch doesn't have it, but there are more batches, the answer is \\\"continue\\\". Therefore, the JSON should have \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\" and no new evidence. \\n\\nBut the user's example might have different logic. Let me check again. The task is to find the first mention. The current batch doesn't have it, so the answer is \\\"not_found\\\" only if there are no more batches. Since there are more batches, the answer is \\\"continue\\\". Therefore, the correct decision is \\\"continue\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1695,\"completion_tokens\":1100,\"total_tokens\":2795}}\n",
