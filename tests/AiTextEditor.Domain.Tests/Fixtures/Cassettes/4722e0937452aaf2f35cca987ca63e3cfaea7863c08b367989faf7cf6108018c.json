The user wants to find the first mention of 'профессор Звёздочкин' after a heading. The context says the text includes this name, and the max evidence count is 1. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check the provided batch items. Each item has a pointer, itemType, and markdown content. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so no previous matches to avoid.\\n\\nLooking at the items:\\n\\n1. Pointer 8:1.1.1.p5 is a Paragraph. The markdown doesn't mention 'профессор Звёздочкин'. It talks about Знайка and other characters but not the professor.\\n\\n2. Pointer 9:1.1.1.p6: Also a Paragraph. The content mentions Знайка and Стекляшкин, but again, no professor.\\n\\n3. Pointer 10:1.1.1.p7: Paragraph. Discusses astronomers arguing about craters. Still no mention of the professor.\\n\\n4. Pointer 11:1.1.1.p8: Paragraph. Here, Знайка and Стекляшкин are mentioned, but again, no professor.\\n\\nWait, none of the paragraphs mention 'профессор Звёздочкин'. The task says the context includes the name, but in the provided batch, maybe it's in a heading? The user mentioned \\\"after the heading\\\", so perhaps a heading in the batch items?\\n\\nLooking again, all items are Paragraphs. There's no heading in the provided batch. The task might refer to a heading in a previous batch, but the current batch doesn't have any. Since the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers is empty, maybe the heading is in an earlier batch not provided here. However, the current batch's items don't have any mention of the professor. \\n\\nSince the user's input might have a heading in a previous batch, but the current batch doesn't contain the professor's name, the answer would be 'not_found'. But the task says the context includes the name, so maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the professor is mentioned in a ListItem or another itemType not shown here. But according to the given data, there's no match. Therefore, the decision should be 'not_found' as the current batch doesn't have the required mention.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1830,\"completion_tokens\":510,\"total_tokens\":2340}}\n",
