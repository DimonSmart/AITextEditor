The user is asking where in the book it's described how the astronomers in the Sun City got into a fight and split into volcanologists and meteoritists. \\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the steps taken so far. The assistant created a keyword cursor with the keywords related to astronomers, Sun City, splitting, volcanologists, and meteoritists. Then, they read batches from the cursor.\\n\\nLooking at the responses, the first batch didn't have the relevant info. The second batch mentioned Znayka's trip and the lunar craters. The third batch had a paragraph where it says the astronomers in Sun City argued about the origin of lunar craters, splitting into two groups: volcanologists and meteoritists. That's exactly what the user is asking for.\\n\\nSo, the answer should point to that specific paragraph. The SemanticPointer for that paragraph is 10:1.1.1.p7. The stop reason is goal_reached because the information was found. No need to continue reading more batches. The final answer should mention the goal and the stop reason, including the semantic pointer.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_eky9i7wt\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":3608,\"completion_tokens\":259,\"total_tokens\":3867}}\n",
