The user wants me to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the provided batch items. The task says to look for all paragraphs containing that term. The snapshot shows that there are already 2 pieces of evidence, and the recent pointers are 8:1.1.1.p5 and 70:1.1.1.p67. But those are from previous batches, so I need to check the current batch's items.\\n\\nLooking at the current batch, there are three items. The first one is pointer 75:1.1.1.p72 with the markdown \\\"– Долой!\\\" which doesn't have \\\"Фуксии\\\". The second is 76:1.1.1.p73, which mentions \\\"трибуну\\\" but not \\\"Фуксии\\\". The third is 77:1.1.1.p74, which also talks about \\\"трибуне\\\" and \\\"травке\\\". None of these paragraphs include \\\"Фуксии\\\". \\n\\nSince none of the current items contain the required term, the newEvidence array should be empty. The decision would be \\\"continue\\\" because there's no new evidence found. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 10, but since we haven't found any new matches, we don't reach that threshold yet. So the output should have decision as \\\"continue\\\" and an empty newEvidence list.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":776,\"completion_tokens\":316,\"total_tokens\":1092}}\n",
