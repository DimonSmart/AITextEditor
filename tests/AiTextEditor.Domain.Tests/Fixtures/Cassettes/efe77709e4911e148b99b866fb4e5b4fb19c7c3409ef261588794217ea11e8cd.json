The user is asking where in the text it's explained why everyone ran away from Ponchik because of naphthalene, and the owners opened the windows and doors. \\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search for mentions of naphthalene and the action of opening windows and doors. The previous assistant created a cursor with the filter \\\"contains 'нафталин' and 'распахивали окна и двери'\\\". The response from the tool was that the cursor was created successfully.\\n\\nNow, the next step is to run the agent on this cursor to find the relevant evidence. The user wants the first mention, so I should set maxEvidenceCount to 1 to stop after the first result. The task description should be to find the first occurrence of these elements.\\n\\nI'll call the agent-run_agent function with the cursor name \\\"search_cursor\\\", task description \\\"Find the first mention of naphthalene and the owners opening windows and doors\\\", and maxEvidenceCount set to 1. This should retrieve the first paragraph that includes both elements. If found, the answer will include the pointer label and the excerpt. If not, I'll check if there are more items by adjusting the parameters, but since maxEvidenceCount is 1, it might stop early. If not found, the answer would state that it's not in the document.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_p1ybk8vg\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of naphthalene and the owners opening windows and doors\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1150,\"completion_tokens\":343,\"total_tokens\":1493}}\n",
