The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with two character names followed by dialogue. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items. The first item is a paragraph discussing the Moon's surface, no dialogue here. The second paragraph also doesn't have any dialogue. The third paragraph starts with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\" which translates to \\\"Volcanologists said:\\\". But there's no second character name mentioned here. The task requires two names followed by dialogue. Since none of the items in this batch have two names and dialogue, there's no evidence to report. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required dialog isn't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1089,\"completion_tokens\":181,\"total_tokens\":1270}}\n",
