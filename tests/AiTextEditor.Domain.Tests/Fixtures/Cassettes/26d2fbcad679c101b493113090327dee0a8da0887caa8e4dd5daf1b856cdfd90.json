The markdown content talks about lunatics moving inside the Moon because the outer surface would get too hot. There's no mention of a professor here. The paragraph discusses the Moon's environment and the reasons for relocation, but no name like Zvezdokhina is present. \\n\\nSince the first batch doesn't have the mention, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" to check subsequent batches. The newEvidence array remains empty because there's no match here. The user might have intended to include a mention in a later batch, so we need to keep scanning. No need to stop here since the answer isn't found yet.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":587,\"completion_tokens\":222,\"total_tokens\":809}}\n",
