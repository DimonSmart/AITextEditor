I've tried several cursors with different filters, but each time it's not found. Let me think about why.\\n\\nMaybe the initial filters were too specific, like requiring direct dialogue or certain phrases. The user might have indirect dialogue or the characters aren't explicitly named in the text. Alternatively, the document might not have such a dialog.\\n\\nSince the latest cursor v5 is looking for any conversational context with two named entities, but still no result. The agent keeps returning not found, so perhaps the document doesn't contain the required information. I should check if there's any possibility of missing it. But since the tools can't scan the entire document, and the cursors are streaming, maybe the first occurrence is in a later portion. However, the user wants the first mention, so if the cursor hasn't found it yet, maybe the document doesn't have it. Alternatively, maybe the names are not properly identified by the current filters. \\n\\nWait, the user might need to check if the document actually has such a dialog. Since the assistant can't access the document's content directly, and the tools are only returning not found, the answer would be that it's not present in the document. So, the correct response is to inform the user that the first dialog between two named characters isn't found in the provided text.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1797,\"completion_tokens\":315,\"total_tokens\":2112}}\n",
