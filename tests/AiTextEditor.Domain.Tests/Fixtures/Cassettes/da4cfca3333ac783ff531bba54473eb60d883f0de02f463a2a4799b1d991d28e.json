The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin, excluding headers. The user provided a batch of items, and I need to scan through them.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the snapshot. The evidenceCount is 0, and recentEvidencePointers is empty. That means no previous matches, so I have to start fresh.\\n\\nLooking at the batch items, the first few are headings, which we should ignore. Then there's a paragraph (4:1.1.1.p1) that mentions \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" in the heading. Wait, no, the heading here is \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\", which is a heading (itemType is Heading). The task says to exclude headers, so that's out.\\n\\nNext, the paragraphs. The first paragraph (4:1.1.1.p1) starts talking about Незнайка's trip and the changes in the city. No mention of the professor here. The second paragraph (5:1.1.1.p2) discusses the factory and clothing, still no mention. Third paragraph (6:1.1.1.p3) talks about Пончик and his clothes, no professor. Fourth paragraph (7:1.1.1.p4) continues about Пончик's problem with moths and the smell. Still no mention of Professor Zvezdokhin.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The headings are excluded, so the only possible mention is in the paragraph content. But none of the paragraphs mention the professor. The heading \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\" is a heading, so it's excluded. So there's no mention in the current batch. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no evidence in the current batch that meets the task's criteria. The user might have intended the heading to be considered, but the task explicitly says to exclude headers. So the answer is that there's no new evidence here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1910,\"completion_tokens\":455,\"total_tokens\":2365}}\n",
