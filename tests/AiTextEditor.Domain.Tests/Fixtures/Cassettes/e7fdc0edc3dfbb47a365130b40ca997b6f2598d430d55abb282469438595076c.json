The goal is to find the first dialog between two named characters and report their names. The context mentions that the paragraph contains at least two named characters. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (pointer 6:1.1.1.p3), the characters mentioned are \\\"Все\\\" (Everyone) and \\\"Пончик\\\" (Ponchik). But there's no dialog here, just descriptions of events. The second paragraph (7:1.1.1.p4) continues the story about Ponchik and the moths, but again, no direct dialogue between two named characters. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first paragraph has \\\"Пончик\\\" and others, but the dialog is between two named characters. The second paragraph mentions \\\"Пончик\\\" and the moths, but no other named character in a dialog. \\n\\nHmm, maybe there's no dialog in the provided batch. The task says to report if there's a dialog, but if not, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\". Since the user provided only two paragraphs and no actual dialog between two named characters, the answer should be \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1274,\"completion_tokens\":277,\"total_tokens\":1551}}\n",
