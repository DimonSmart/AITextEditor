Let me start by creating a cursor to find all paragraphs containing his name. I'll use the cursor-create_cursor function with a filter for paragraphs with 'профессора Звёздочкина'. \\n\\nFirst, I need to make sure the cursor is set up correctly. The filter should capture all instances where his name appears. Since the user wants the second mention, I'll have to iterate through the results. \\n\\nAfter creating the cursor, I'll run the agent to get the first few results. The first result will be the first mention, so the next one should be the second. I need to check each paragraph returned by the cursor to count the mentions. \\n\\nWait, the user mentioned excluding headers, so I should ensure that the cursor isn't picking up any headings. The filter is set to paragraphs, which should handle that. But I should verify each result to make sure it's a regular paragraph and not a header. \\n\\nOnce I get the results, I'll list them in order. The second occurrence in the list will be the answer. If the first result has two mentions, I need to check if the second mention is within the same paragraph or the next one. \\n\\nI should also keep track of the pointers to locate the exact position in the document. If the cursor returns more than two mentions, I'll need to stop at the second one. If not, I'll continue querying the next portions until I find the second mention. \\n\\nFinally, I'll present the answer with the pointer label and the relevant paragraph, ensuring it's in Russian as requested.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_lch573zu\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":2,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first two mentions of профессора Звёздочкина\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1355,\"completion_tokens\":397,\"total_tokens\":1752}}\n",
