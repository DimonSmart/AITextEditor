Let me start by creating a cursor to search for mentions of Fuchsia. I'll use the cursor-create_cursor function with a filter description that looks for the term \\\"Фуксия\\\". Then, I'll run the agent to find the first occurrence. If the first result doesn't mention it, I'll check the next items. But since the user wants the first mention, I should set maxEvidenceCount to 1 to stop after the first hit. Wait, but maybe the first item contains multiple mentions. So I need to read the excerpt carefully. If the cursor returns a paragraph that includes the first mention, I'll note that. If not, continue. Also, check if there's a heading that might be metadata, but the user specified to look in the text, not headings. Alright, let's proceed step by step.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_rbi9qc7v\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"Mentions of Фуксия\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"maxElements\\\":1000,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1119,\"completion_tokens\":249,\"total_tokens\":1368}}\n",
