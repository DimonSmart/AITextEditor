The user wants the first dialogue between two named characters and their names. I remember the assistant created a cursor called dialogue_cursor with a filter for lines containing dialogue markers or character names. Now, the response from the tool is \\\"dialogue_cursor\\\", which probably means the cursor was created successfully.\\n\\nNext, I need to run the agent on this cursor to find the first dialogue. The task description should be to find the first dialogue between two named characters. I'll use the agent-run_agent function with the cursor name and set maxEvidenceCount to 1 to get the first occurrence. \\n\\nWait, the user specified \\\"первый диалог между двумя названными по имени персонажами\\\", so I need to ensure the dialogue involves two characters named by their names. The filter might have captured lines with names, but the agent needs to check for actual dialogue between two. Let me structure the task description as \\\"Find the first dialogue between two named characters\\\" and use the cursor. \\n\\nI should call agent-run_agent with cursorName \\\"dialogue_cursor\\\" and taskDescription in Russian as \\\"Найдите первый диалог между двумя названными персонажами\\\". Also, set maxEvidenceCount to 1 to stop after the first result. Then, check the response. If it returns evidence, extract the names from the dialogue markers. If not, maybe the cursor needs to be adjusted or more iterations are needed. But since the user wants the first occurrence, this should work.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_yz4lqlfj\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"dialogue_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Найдите первый диалог между двумя названными персонажами\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1417,\"completion_tokens\":381,\"total_tokens\":1798}}\n",
