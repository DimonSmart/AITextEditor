The user wants to find all mentions of 'профессора Звёздочкина' excluding headers. The task says to scan the current batch items. Let me look at the provided batch.\\n\\nThe first item is a heading with pointer 1:1, which is a main heading. The second is a subheading 2:1.1, also a heading. The third item has pointer 3:1.1.1 and is a heading as well. The markdown for the third item is \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". \\n\\nWait, the task says to exclude headers, so any item with itemType \\\"Heading\\\" should be skipped. All three items here are headings. So none of them should be considered. But the user mentioned that the snapshot has evidenceCount 0 and recentEvidencePointers empty. Since there are no non-header items in the batch, there's no evidence to extract. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there are no matches in the current batch. The output JSON should reflect that no new evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":668,\"completion_tokens\":250,\"total_tokens\":918}}\n",
