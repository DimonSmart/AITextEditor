The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions looking for direct speech markers like quotes or dashes. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once we find one, we should stop.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, all the paragraphs are in Russian. Let me check each one carefully. \\n\\nThe first paragraph (21:1.1.1.p18) talks about Znayka and his observations on the Moon. There's no dialogue here, just narration. \\n\\nThe second paragraph (22:1.1.1.p19) mentions Znayka publishing a book about the lunar inhabitants, the Lunitiks. Again, it's a narrative, no direct speech. \\n\\nThe third paragraph (23:1.1.1.p20) continues the story of the Lunitiks moving inside the Moon. Still no dialogue. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me scan again. All the text is descriptive, explaining Znayka's findings and the Lunitiks' history. There's no direct dialogue between two characters here. The task is to find the first dialogue, but in the current batch, there's no evidence of any dialogue. \\n\\nSince the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0 and the batch doesn't have any dialogues, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the user mentioned that if no evidence is found, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\". So the correct output is to indicate that no evidence was found in this batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1291,\"completion_tokens\":337,\"total_tokens\":1628}}\n",
