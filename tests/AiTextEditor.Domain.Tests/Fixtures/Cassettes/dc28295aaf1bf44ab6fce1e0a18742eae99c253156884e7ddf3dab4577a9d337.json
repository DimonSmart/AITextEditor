The user is asking where Пончик is first mentioned in the book. I need to find the earliest occurrence of the name \\\"Пончик\\\" in the text.\\n\\nFirst, I created a cursor named \\\"search_cursor\\\" with a filter to find any text containing \\\"Пончик\\\". Then, I used the agent to run the task, scanning the document in batches. The first response found a mention where Пончик is described as the only one who suffered in a situation. But the user might be looking for the very first mention, so I need to check if there's an earlier instance.\\n\\nThe next batch didn't return new evidence, but the status says there are more items available. That means the cursor hasn't finished scanning. I should continue running the agent with the same cursor to check subsequent batches. It's possible that the first mention is in a later portion of the document. I'll keep querying until the cursor completes or the answer is found. If the cursor eventually returns \\\"cursor_complete\\\" and no more evidence, then the answer is in the last batch processed. Otherwise, the first mention will be in one of the batches we've checked.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_a427lyuf\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of Пончик\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1453,\"completion_tokens\":278,\"total_tokens\":1731}}\n",
