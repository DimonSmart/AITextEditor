The user wants to find the second mention of Professor Zvezdochkin, excluding headers. The task is in Russian, so I need to make sure I'm looking for the correct name. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so no previous matches.\\n\\nLooking at the batch items, each has a pointer and markdown content. I need to scan through each paragraph to find mentions of Professor Zvezdochkin. The first mention is in paragraph 24:1.1.1.p21, where he's introduced. The next mention should be the second occurrence. Checking the subsequent paragraphs, paragraph 25:1.1.1.p22 mentions him again as the one who proposed the discussion. That's the second mention. I need to make sure not to include any headers, but since the items are paragraphs, that's already handled. So the newEvidence should include the pointer from p22 and the excerpt. The reason is that the excerpt directly mentions Professor Zvezdochkin in the context of proposing the discussion. Since the task is to find the second mention, and the first was in the previous batch, this should be the second. The decision would be \\\"continue\\\" because the user might need more, but since the task is to find the second, and we found it, maybe \\\"done\\\"? Wait, the task says \\\"найти второе упоминание\\\", so once we find the second, we can set decision to \\\"done\\\". But according to the rules, if the task depends on counts, we need to check if the target is met. The target here is 2. Since snapshot.evidenceCount was 0, and we found one in this batch, that's the second. So decision should be \\\"done\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2623,\"completion_tokens\":538,\"total_tokens\":3161}}\n",
