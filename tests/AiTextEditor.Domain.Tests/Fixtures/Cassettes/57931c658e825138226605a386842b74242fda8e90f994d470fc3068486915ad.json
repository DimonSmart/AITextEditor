Now, I need to read the batches from this cursor to find the information.\\n\\nI'll start by reading the first batch from the cursor. If the information isn't there, I'll continue reading subsequent batches. It's possible they are mentioned in different parts of the document, so I need to check each batch carefully. Also, since the user wants the first mention, I should note the earliest occurrence.
