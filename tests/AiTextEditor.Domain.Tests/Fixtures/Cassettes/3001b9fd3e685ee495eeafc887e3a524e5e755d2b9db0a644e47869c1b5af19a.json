The user wants to find all mentions of 'профессора Звёздочкина' in the provided batch, excluding headers. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to check if the term appears in the markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", the markdown is a paragraph about Знайка's trip to the Moon. I'll search for 'профессора Звёздочкина' here. Scanning through the text, I don't see that exact phrase. The names mentioned are Фуксией, Селёдочкой, and Стекляшкин, but not Звёздочкина.\\n\\nNext, the second item has pointer \\\"9:1.1.1.p6\\\". The markdown talks about Знайка returning to the Flower City and mentioning Professor Стекляшкин. Again, I'll look for 'профессора Звёздочкина'. The text mentions Стекляшкин, but not Звёздочкина. \\n\\nSince neither of the paragraphs contains 'профессора Звёздочкина', there are no matches. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and the recentEvidencePointers are empty. Since the task doesn't specify a maxEvidenceCount, but the user wants all mentions, and none are found, the decision should be 'not_found'. \\n\\nI need to make sure not to include any headers and that the pointers aren't in the recentEvidencePointers. Since there are no matches, the newEvidence array remains empty. Therefore, the output is 'not_found' with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1316,\"completion_tokens\":368,\"total_tokens\":1684}}\n",
