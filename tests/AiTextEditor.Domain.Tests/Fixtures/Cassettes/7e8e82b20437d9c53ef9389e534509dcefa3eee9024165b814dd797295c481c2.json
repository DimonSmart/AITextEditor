The user asked to find the first mention of Professor Zv\u0451zdokin and rewrite the paragraph, adding that the apples started to bloom at that moment. \\n\\nFirst, the assistant called the RunCursorAgent function with the cursor name ZvezdokinCursor, mode FirstMatch, and the task description. But the response said the cursor wasn\u0027t found. So, the assistant then tried to create the cursor using CreateCursor, which was successful. Now, the next step is probably to use the CursorNext function to get the next chunk from the cursor to find the first mention.\\n\\nWait, but the user\u0027s original request was to find the first occurrence. Since the cursor was created, maybe the agent needs to navigate through the content. However, the RunCursorAgent might have failed because the cursor didn\u0027t exist before. Now that the cursor is created, perhaps the agent should be run again with the correct parameters. Or maybe the assistant needs to use CursorNext to retrieve the data step by step.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the RunCursorAgent was supposed to handle the navigation, but since the cursor wasn\u0027t created yet, it failed. Now that the cursor exists, the assistant should reattempt the RunCursorAgent with the same parameters. But the user might need to confirm if the cursor is properly set up. Also, the task description needs to include adding the apple blooming detail. So, after finding the first mention, the assistant should process that information and insert the additional detail about the apples.\\n\u0022,\u0022tool_calls\u0022:[{\u0022id\u0022:\u0022call_iyj7gxzx\u0022,\u0022index\u0022:0,\u0022type\u0022:\u0022function\u0022,\u0022function\u0022:{\u0022name\u0022:\u0022CursorAgentPlugin-RunCursorAgent\u0022,\u0022arguments\u0022:\u0022{\\\u0022cursorName\\\u0022:\\\u0022ZvezdokinCursor\\\u0022,\\\u0022maxSteps\\\u0022:100,\\\u0022mode\\\u0022:\\\u0022FirstMatch\\\u0022,\\\u0022taskDescription\\\u0022:\\\u0022Find the first mention of \u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D and note the moment when apples began to bloom.\\\u0022}\u0022}}]},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022tool_calls\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:919,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:386,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:1305}}\n",
