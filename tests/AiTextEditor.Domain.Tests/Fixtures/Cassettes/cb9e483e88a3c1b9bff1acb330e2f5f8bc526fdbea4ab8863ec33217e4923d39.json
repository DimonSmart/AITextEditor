The user wants to find a place in the text where Znayka sarcastically comments on the professor's phrase about the center of the Moon. The task is to scan the current batch items for evidence.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check each paragraph's markdown content for any mention of Znayka's sarcastic remark related to the professor's statement about the Moon's center. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so no previous matches. The recentEvidencePointers are empty, so no duplicates to avoid.\\n\\nLooking through the items:\\n\\n- Paragraph 9 talks about Znayka's theory about the Moon's surface but doesn't mention the professor or the center.\\n- Paragraph 10 mentions astronomers laughing at Znayka's theory, but again, no specific reference to the professor's phrase about the center.\\n- Paragraphs 11-15 discuss volcanic and meteorite theories, with Znayka countering them. Still, no mention of the professor's specific phrase.\\n- Paragraph 16 has Znayka arguing against meteorites, but again, not the professor's comment on the Moon's center.\\n- Paragraph 20 mentions the professor's dismissive nickname \\\"блинист\\\" (blini) and their comment comparing the Moon to a pancake, but that's about the shape, not the center.\\n- Paragraph 21 and 22 discuss Znayka's later theory about lunar inhabitants, which isn't related.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. The task is about Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor's phrase about the Moon's center. The key is to find a direct mention where Znayka mocks the professor's statement regarding the Moon's center. However, in the provided text, Znayka's arguments are about the Moon's surface composition and structures, not the center. The only mention of the professor is in paragraph 20, where they call him a \\\"блинист\\\" for his pancake theory, but that's about the shape, not the center. There's no explicit mention of the professor's phrase about the Moon's center. Therefore, there's no evidence in the current batch that matches the task. So the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there's no relevant excerpt found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2411,\"completion_tokens\":493,\"total_tokens\":2904}}\n",
