The user is asking where the first mention of \\\u0022\u041F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A\\\u0022 is in the document. I\u0027ve been running the CursorAgent in FirstMatch mode multiple times, but each time it\u0027s still ongoing. The state shows that it hasn\u0027t found anything yet, and the progress is still ongoing.\\n\\nHmm, maybe I need to check if there\u0027s a mistake in the task description. The user said \\\u0022\u041F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A\\\u0022, but maybe the actual text uses a different spelling or case? Wait, the task description says \\\u0022\u043D\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043F\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043E\u0435 \u0443\u043F\u043E\u043C\u0438\u043D\u0430\u043D\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043B\u043E\u0432\u0430 \u0027\u041F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A\u0027 \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u043A\u0441\u0442\u0435, \u0438\u0433\u043D\u043E\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044F \u0437\u0430\u0433\u043E\u043B\u043E\u0432\u043A\u0438\\\u0022. So it\u0027s looking for the exact word \\\u0022\u041F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A\\\u0022 in the text, ignoring headings.\\n\\nBut the agent hasn\u0027t found it yet after four steps. Maybe the document doesn\u0027t have that word? Or maybe the cursor hasn\u0027t reached the part where it\u0027s mentioned yet. Since the cursor is moving forward, each step processes the next chunk of the document.\\n\\nWait, the problem might be that the agent is still searching, but maybe the word is in a later part. However, the user is expecting an answer. But according to the tools, if the document doesn\u0027t have the answer, I should say it\u0027s not found.\\n\\nBut the current state shows \\\u0022found\\\u0022: false, and the evidence is empty. So after multiple steps, it hasn\u0027t found anything. Maybe the word \\\u0022\u041F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A\\\u0022 isn\u0027t in the document at all. But how do I know for sure? The agent is still running, but maybe it\u0027s reached the end of the document without finding it.\\n\\nWait, the \\\u0022remaining\\\u0022 steps are decreasing each time. Let\u0027s see: first step remaining 126, then 125, 124... So after 128 steps, it would stop. But maybe the document is shorter than that. However, the current state is still ongoing, but maybe the next step will finish.\\n\\nBut the user is waiting for an answer. Since the agent hasn\u0027t found it yet, and after several steps, perhaps it\u0027s safe to assume that the word isn\u0027t present. But the tools don\u0027t have a way to know unless the agent completes the search.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the agent is stuck in an infinite loop, but the maxSteps is 128, so it will stop eventually. But since the user is asking now, and the current state is still ongoing, but the previous responses didn\u0027t find anything, perhaps the answer is that it\u0027s not found.\\n\\nWait, but the problem is that the agent hasn\u0027t completed yet. However, the user might need to wait for the agent to finish. But in the current setup, the assistant has to keep calling the RunCursorAgent until it either finds it or completes.\\n\\nBut looking at the previous tool responses, each time the state is \\\u0022ongoing\\\u0022 with remaining steps decreasing. So maybe after a few more steps, it will either find it or finish.\\n\\nBut the user is expecting a response. However, the assistant can\u0027t just stop the process; it has to keep running the agent until it\u0027s done. But in the current setup, the assistant is supposed to keep making tool calls until the response is successful.\\n\\nWait, but the last tool response was still ongoing. So maybe the next step would be to call RunCursorAgent again. But the user might not want to wait for multiple steps. However, according to the workflow, the assistant should continue until it gets a success or failure.\\n\\nBut in the current scenario, the assistant has to keep making the same call until the agent either finds the word or exhausts the steps.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the document doesn\u0027t contain \\\u0022\u041F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A\\\u0022 at all. Let\u0027s check the current state: \\\u0022found\\\u0022: false, \\\u0022evidence\\\u0022: [], so no matches found yet.\\n\\nBut how many steps have been taken? The step count is 4, remaining 124. So there are still many steps left. But maybe the word is in the next chunk.\\n\\nHowever, the assistant can\u0027t know for sure until the agent completes. But since the user is waiting, perhaps the correct response is to continue the process. But the assistant has to keep making the tool calls until it gets a success.\\n\\nBut the problem is that the user is asking for the answer now. However, the assistant can\u0027t provide an answer until the agent finishes. So the assistant should keep calling the RunCursorAgent until it either finds it or the steps are exhausted.\\n\\nBut in the current setup, the assistant has to make the next tool call. Let\u0027s see the next step.\\n\\nWait, the previous tool response was still ongoing, so the assistant should call RunCursorAgent again with the same state. But maybe after a few more steps, it will find it or not.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the word is not present. But how to confirm?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the word is present but in a different case, like \\\u0022\u043F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A\\\u0022 lowercase. But the task description says to look for \u0027\u041F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A\u0027 with capital P. So if the text has it in lowercase, it might not match.\\n\\nBut the agent\u0027s task is to find the exact word as specified. So if the document has \\\u0022\u043F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A\\\u0022 in lowercase, it won\u0027t match unless the search is case-insensitive. But the task description doesn\u0027t specify case sensitivity. However, the agent might be case-sensitive by default.\\n\\nBut the user\u0027s question is in Russian, and \\\u0022\u041F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A\\\u0022 is a name, so it\u0027s likely capitalized. But maybe in the document, it\u0027s written differently.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the word is part of a larger word, like \\\u0022\u041F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A\u043E\u0432\u0441\u043A\u0438\u0439\\\u0022, but the task is to find the exact word. So the agent would look for the exact string.\\n\\nBut without seeing the actual document, it\u0027s hard to say. However, the agent is supposed to search through the document.\\n\\nGiven that the current state is still ongoing, the assistant should continue making the RunCursorAgent calls until it either finds it or completes.\\n\\nBut the user is waiting for a response. However, the assistant can\u0027t provide an answer until the agent finishes. So the next step is to call RunCursorAgent again with the current state.\\n\\nBut the previous responses show that each time the step increases and remaining steps decrease. So after 128 steps, it would stop. But maybe the document is large, and the word is in the later part.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the word isn\u0027t present. But the assistant can\u0027t know until the agent finishes.\\n\\nBut the current state shows \\\u0022found\\\u0022: false, so if the agent completes without finding it, then the answer is not found.\\n\\nSo the assistant should keep making the calls until the agent returns a success or failure.\\n\\nBut in the current setup, the assistant has to keep doing that. However, the user might not want to wait for multiple steps. But according to the workflow, the assistant must continue until it gets a result.\\n\\nSo the next step is to call RunCursorAgent again with the current state.\\n\\nWait, but the user\u0027s last message was the tool response showing ongoing, so the assistant needs to respond by making another tool call.\\n\\nSo the next step is to call RunCursorAgent again with the same parameters, but with the updated state.\\n\\nLooking at the last tool response:\\n\\n{\\\u0022success\\\u0022:false,\\\u0022reason\\\u0022:\\\u0022ongoing\\\u0022,\\\u0022summary\\\u0022:\\\u0022ongoing\\\u0022,\\\u0022taskId\\\u0022:\\\u002261a9e7395d2b4b13a4faf6f647f1b9c9\\\u0022,\\\u0022state\\\u0022:{\\\u0022goal\\\u0022:\\\u0022\\\\u043D\\\\u0430\\\\u0439\\\\u0442\\\\u0438 \\\\u043F\\\\u0435\\\\u0440\\\\u0432\\\\u043E\\\\u0435 \\\\u0443\\\\u043F\\\\u043E\\\\u043C\\\\u0438\\\\u043D\\\\u0430\\\\u043D\\\\u0438\\\\u0435 \\\\u0441\\\\u043B\\\\u043E\\\\u0432\\\\u0430 \\\\u0027\\\\u041F\\\\u043E\\\\u043D\\\\u0447\\\\u0438\\\\u043A\\\\u0027 \\\\u0432 \\\\u0442\\\\u0435\\\\u043A\\\\u0441\\\\u0442\\\\u0435, \\\\u0438\\\\u0433\\\\u043D\\\\u043E\\\\u0440\\\\u0438\\\\u0440\\\\u0443\\\\u044F \\\\u0437\\\\u0430\\\\u0433\\\\u043E\\\\u043B\\\\u043E\\\\u0432\\\\u043A\\\\u0438\\\u0022,\\\u0022found\\\u0022:false,\\\u0022seen\\\u0022:[],\\\u0022progress\\\u0022:\\\u0022ongoing\\\u0022,\\\u0022limits\\\u0022:{\\\u0022step\\\u0022:4,\\\u0022maxSteps\\\u0022:128,\\\u0022maxSeenTail\\\u0022:200,\\\u0022maxFound\\\u0022:20,\\\u0022remaining\\\u0022:124},\\\u0022evidence\\\u0022:[]}}\\n\\nSo the next call should be with the same cursorName, mode, state, taskDescription, and taskId.\\n\\nSo the assistant should generate another RunCursorAgent call with the current state.\\n\\nBut the user is waiting for the answer.
