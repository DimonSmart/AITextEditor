The user is asking where the description of astronomers in the Sun City arguing and splitting into volcanologists and meteoritologists is mentioned. So, I need to find the part in the document where this happens.\\n\\nFirst, I created a keyword cursor with the keywords: астрономы, солнечном, разделились, вулканисты, метеоритчики. Then I read the batches. The first batch didn't have the keywords, but the second one had some mentions of Солнечном and астрономы. However, the splitting into groups isn't there yet. \\n\\nContinuing to the next batches, the third batch mentions Знайка and his travels, but not the argument. The fourth batch talks about Стекляшкин, an astronomer, but no conflict. The fifth batch might have the answer. Wait, in the fifth batch, there's a mention of астрономы and Стекляшкин, but the splitting into volcanologists and meteoritologists isn't there. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed a batch. Let me check again. The user's question is about a conflict between astronomers splitting into two groups. The keywords I used include \\\"разделились\\\", which means split. But in the batches read so far, there's no mention of that split. Maybe the next batch will have it. Let me continue reading the next portion. \\n\\nWait, the last batch's nextAfterPointer is \\\"9:1.1.1.p6\\\", so the next read would be after that. But the user's answer might not be in the provided batches. Maybe the split is described in a later part of the document. Since the current batches don't have the required keywords, I need to keep reading until the cursor reaches the end or finds the relevant section. The user might need to continue the search until the split is found. Since the current steps haven't reached the answer yet, the next step is to read the next batch to check for the keywords.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_eg2y3o1m\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2806,\"completion_tokens\":452,\"total_tokens\":3258}}\n",
