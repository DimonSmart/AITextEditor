The task is to find the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the given batch. The user provided a snapshot with evidenceCount 1 and recentEvidencePointers including \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". But the current batch has items with pointers 81:1.1.1.p78, 82:1.1.1.p79, and 83:1.2. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check each item's markdown content. The first item's markdown is \\\"– На этом заседание объявляю закрытым.\\\" No mention of Пончик here. The second item says \\\"После чего встал и тоже пошёл домой.\\\" Still no Пончик. The third is a heading, so probably not relevant. \\n\\nSince none of the current batch items mention Пончик, there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the task is to find the first mention, but it's not present in this batch. Also, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers might have a previous match, but the current batch doesn't contribute any new evidence. So the answer is to indicate that no new evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":684,\"completion_tokens\":279,\"total_tokens\":963}}\n",
