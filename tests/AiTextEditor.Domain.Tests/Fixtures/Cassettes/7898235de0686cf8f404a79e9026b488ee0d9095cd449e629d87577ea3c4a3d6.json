The user wants me to find the first mention of a clothing factory producing rubber bras and synthetic fur coats. The context is about paragraphs mentioning 'одёжная фабрика' and listing products from rubber bras to synthetic fur coats. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence, with the pointer \\\"5:1.1.1.p2\\\". But the current batch items don't have any pointers related to 'одёжная фабрика' or the products mentioned. The items in the batch are about lunar craters and meteorites, which don't relate to the task. Since there's no relevant content in the current batch, I should output 'not_found' and no new evidence. Also, the decision should be 'continue' because there's no evidence here. Wait, the user's output schema requires 'decision' to be 'continue', 'done', or 'not_found'. Since there's no evidence in this batch, the correct decision is 'not_found'. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any pointers. Let me check again. The batch items are pointers 18:1.1.1.p15, 19:1.1.1.p16, 20:1.1.1.p17. None of these mention the clothing factory or the products. So, no new evidence can be added. Therefore, the response should be 'not_found' with an empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":923,\"completion_tokens\":325,\"total_tokens\":1248}}\n",
