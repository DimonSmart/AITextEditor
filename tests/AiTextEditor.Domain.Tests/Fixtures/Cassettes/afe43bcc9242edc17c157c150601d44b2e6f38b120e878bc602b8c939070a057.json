The user wants to find a paragraph where Znayka compares the lunar surface to a well-baked blini and explains the steam bubbles. First, I need to scan the current batch's items.\\n\\nLooking at the provided data, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include some pointers, but the user said not to use those. The current batch has items from 74 to 86. Let me check each paragraph.\\n\\nStarting with pointer 74: It's about Zvezdochkin being dragged out, no mention of blini or steam. Pointer 75: \\\"Долой!\\\" just a shout. 76: Dragged to the grass, still not relevant. 77: Told to sit on the grass, maybe the grass is part of the blini? Not sure. 78: Zvezdochkin shouts, but no comparison. 79: Declares the meeting closed. \\n\\nThen chapter two starts. Pointer 83 is a heading. 84 is another heading. Pointer 85: Talks about the newspaper report, mentions Znayka's book, but no blini. The paragraph mentions the moon's interior and the inhabitants, but not the blini comparison. \\n\\nPointer 86 is truncated, so maybe the steam bubbles are there? But the user's query mentions \\\"объясняет пузырьки пара\\\" (explains steam bubbles). Wait, the task is about Znayka comparing the lunar surface to a blini and explaining the steam bubbles. \\n\\nLooking through the paragraphs again, maybe I missed something. The user's task is specific: the comparison to blini and explaining the steam bubbles. None of the provided paragraphs in the current batch mention blini or steam bubbles. The only mention of blini is in the task, not in the batch items. \\n\\nSo, there's no evidence in the current batch that matches the task. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1516,\"completion_tokens\":431,\"total_tokens\":1947}}\n",
