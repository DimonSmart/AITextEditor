The user is asking for the fourth mention of Professor Zvezdochkin in the book, excluding headers. I need to find where that occurs.\\n\\nFirst, I created a keyword cursor with \\\"звёздочкин\\\" and read the first batch. The first three mentions are in paragraphs 21, 22, and 23. The next batch will give the fourth one. Let me check the next items. The next pointer is 26:1.1.1.p23, which is the third item. Wait, the first batch had three items, so the fourth must be in the next batch. I'll read the next batch to find the fourth mention. Once I get that, I can note the semantic pointer and provide the answer.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_fv4gw4tm\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1827,\"completion_tokens\":192,\"total_tokens\":2019}}\n",
