Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to use the tools provided. The available functions are CursorAgentPlugin-TargetSetCreate, CursorAgentPlugin-TargetSetAdd, CursorAgentPlugin-TargetSetGet, and CursorAgentPlugin-RunCursorAgent. \\n\\nThe user wants the first mention of the professor, so I should use the RunCursorAgent function to search through the document. The task is to find the first occurrence of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" in the content, not in any headings. \\n\\nI should set up the cursor agent to look for this term. The parameters for RunCursorAgent include maxElements, maxBytes, includeContent, taskDescription, and possibly targetSetId. Since the user wants the first mention, I need to make sure the agent stops after finding the first instance. \\n\\nWait, the function's parameters don't have a 'stopAfterFirst' option. But the user wants the first occurrence, so maybe after the agent finds the first match, it should stop. However, the tool might not support that directly. Alternatively, I can use the target set to collect the pointers and then retrieve the first one. \\n\\nLet me outline the steps: \\n\\n1. Create a target set to collect the pointers where the term is found.\\n2. Run the cursor agent with the task to find mentions of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\", including content, and add the pointers to the target set.\\n3. Once the agent has processed the relevant sections, retrieve the pointers from the target set and return the first one.\\n\\nBut the user wants the first mention, so maybe the agent can be instructed to find the first occurrence. However, the tool's parameters don't specify stopping after the first match. So perhaps the agent will return all matches, and then I can take the first one from the results. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the agent can be set to find the first occurrence by limiting the search. But I need to check the function's parameters. The RunCursorAgent function has parameters like maxElements and maxBytes, which control how much data is processed. If I set maxElements to 1, maybe it will stop after the first match. But I'm not sure if that's how it works. \\n\\nAlternatively, the agent might process the entire document and return all matches, so the first one in the list would be the answer. \\n\\nIn any case, the correct approach is to use the RunCursorAgent function with the task description to find the first mention. Let me structure the tool call accordingly. \\n\\nSo, the taskDescription should be \\\"Найдите первое упоминание профессора Звёздочкин в тексте, исключая заголовки.\\\" The includeContent should be true to get the actual text. The maxElements and maxBytes can be set to reasonable values to process the document. \\n\\nThen, after running the agent, the response will include the pointers. The first pointer in the result would be the answer. \\n\\nI need to make sure that the agent is set to include content and that the task is precise. Also, the targetSetId might be used to collect the pointers, but if the user just wants the first occurrence, maybe the agent's response will directly include the first match. \\n\\nSo, the plan is to call RunCursorAgent with the task to find the first mention, include content, and then extract the first pointer from the result. \\n\\nNow, I'll structure the tool call accordingly.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_n0y14u1r\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"CursorAgentPlugin-RunCursorAgent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"includeContent\\\":true,\\\"maxBytes\\\":32768,\\\"maxElements\\\":50,\\\"targetSetId\\\":\\\"targetSet123\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Найдите первое упоминание профессора Звёздочкин в тексте, исключая заголовки.\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":694,\"completion_tokens\":838,\"total_tokens\":1532}}\n",
