No mention of Фуксии here. \\n\\nNext, pointer 58:1.1.1.p55. The paragraph describes feelings after losing weight, like losing a seat and feeling dizzy. Still nothing about Фуксии. \\n\\nThen, pointer 59:1.1.1.p56. The markdown has people shouting for Знайка to continue. Again, no Фуксии. \\n\\nNone of the items in this batch mention 'Фуксии'. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", which isn't in the current batch. So, there's no new evidence here.
