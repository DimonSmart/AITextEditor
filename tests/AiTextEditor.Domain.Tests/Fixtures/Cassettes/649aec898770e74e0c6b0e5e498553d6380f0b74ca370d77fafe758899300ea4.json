The user wants the first mention of Znayka comparing the lunar surface to a pancake and steam bubbles. First, I need to check the provided batch items.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (pointer 4:1.1.1.p1), it talks about Nезнайка's trip to the Sun City and mentions the Flower City's changes. There's a mention of \\\"Знайка\\\" here, but the comparison to pancake or steam bubbles isn't present. The text describes buildings and structures but not the lunar surface.\\n\\nThe second paragraph (pointer 5:1.1.1.p2) discusses the construction projects and a clothing factory. Again, \\\"Знайка\\\" isn't mentioned here. The content is about industrial developments, not lunar features. \\n\\nSince neither paragraph mentions Znayka comparing the lunar surface to a pancake or steam bubbles, there's no relevant evidence in the current batch. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and the recentEvidencePointers are empty. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" as there's no matching content in the provided items.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1276,\"completion_tokens\":253,\"total_tokens\":1529}}\n",
