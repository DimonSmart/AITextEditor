The goal is to find the first mention of Ponchik throwing old costumes into the Ogurcovna River. The context is all paragraphs mentioning Ponchik and the Ogurcovna River. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check the current batch's items. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence with pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch has two items: pointers 8:1.1.1.p5 and 9:1.1.1.p6.\\n\\nLooking at the markdown for pointer 8:1.1.1.p5, it talks about Znayka's trip to the Sun City, meeting Fuxia and Selodka, and their moon trip. There's no mention of Ponchik or the Ogurcovna River here. \\n\\nNext, pointer 9:1.1.1.p6 is about Znayka returning to the Flower City and talking about his trip. It discusses the Moon's surface and craters. Again, no Ponchik or Ogurcovna River mentioned here either. \\n\\nSince neither of the current batch's items mention Ponchik or the Ogurcovna River, there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required information isn't present in the current batch. The user might need to check subsequent batches, but based on what's provided, there's nothing to report.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1324,\"completion_tokens\":328,\"total_tokens\":1652}}\n",
