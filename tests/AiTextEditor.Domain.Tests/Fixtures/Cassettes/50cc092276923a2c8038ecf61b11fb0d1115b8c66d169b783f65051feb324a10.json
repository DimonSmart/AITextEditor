Continue a few more.We may be stuck. Perhaps we should request more aggressively? Already repeating. Maybe the system expects us to request until matches. Continue.If after many attempts no result, we need to finish not found. But no signal.\\n\\nProbably soon we will get match. Continue.We could be in loop. Possibly we missed match earlier? Let\u0027s think: The first item didn\u0027t have. We need to scan each. Continue.\\n\\nWe might consider that the cursor will eventually exhaust. We should continue until hasMore false then finish not found. Let\u0027s keep a few more.If the next response indicates hasMore false, we finish not found.We need to wait for response.We may need to stop asking after many attempts. But still no result. Probably the user will provide a result soon containing \u041F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A. Let\u0027s continue at least one more.If still no. Hmm.\\n\\nMaybe we should ask for a large batch? But cursor_next doesn\u0027t accept size param. We\u0027ll continue.We need to wait for response.At this point, maybe we should consider finishing not found after many tries. But we haven\u0027t seen hasMore false. The safe approach: continue until hasMore false. We\u0027ll request one more.We need to see if they return no more.Given the repeated calls, maybe the system will now return hasMore false. If so, we should finish not found. We\u0027ll wait for that.If response shows hasMore false, we finish not found with summary. But we haven\u0027t yet.
