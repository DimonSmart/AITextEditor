I tried creating different cursors with varying filters, but each time it came back as not found. Let me think about why that might be.\\n\\nFirst, maybe the initial filters were too specific. The user mentioned \\\"direct dialogue,\\\" but maybe the book uses indirect speech or dialogue tags that aren't captured by the initial filters. For example, instead of \\\"Alice: Hello, Bob,\\\" it might be \\\"Alice said, 'Hello, Bob.'\\\" My previous cursors focused on direct quotes, but maybe the book uses different formatting.\\n\\nAlso, the filter descriptions in the cursors might not account for all variations. The user's latest cursor (v4) includes indirect dialogue and sentences with two named entities. But if the book's dialogues are all indirect or have different structures, the cursor might not pick them up. \\n\\nAnother possibility is that the book doesn't have any dialogues between two named characters, or the dialogues are not marked clearly. Since the user is asking for the first occurrence, maybe the dialogues are spread out, and the cursors aren't scanning enough of the document. The maxEvidenceCount was set to 1, but maybe the first occurrence is in a later portion. However, the status says more items are available, so the cursor might not be reaching the right section yet.\\n\\nI should adjust the filter to be more inclusive, perhaps looking for any mention of two names in the same sentence, even if it's not a direct quote. Also, checking if the document has any dialogues at all. If the cursors are still not finding anything, maybe the answer is that there's no such dialogue in the document. But since the user is asking, it's more likely that I need to refine the cursor parameters further.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_fkekycic\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"dialogue_cursor_v4\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Detect the first instance of dialogue (direct/indirect) involving two distinct named characters in the same sentence\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1628,\"completion_tokens\":432,\"total_tokens\":2060}}\n",
