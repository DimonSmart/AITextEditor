Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search through the document. The cursor should look for mentions of Ponchik. Since the user wants the first mention, the filter should be set to find any occurrence of the name. I'll use the cursor-create_cursor function with a filter description that checks for the presence of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the text. \\n\\nI'll name the cursor \\\"search_cursor\\\" and set the filterDescription to \\\"All paragraphs containing 'Пончик'\\\". Then, I'll run the agent using this cursor to find the first occurrence. The agent will process the document in portions, so I might need to call run_agent multiple times until it finds the mention or completes the scan. \\n\\nOnce the agent returns the evidence items, I'll check the first item to see if it contains the first mention. If not, I'll continue scanning with the same cursor. I need to make sure to use the correct parameters and not miss any paragraphs. Also, since the user wants the first mention, I should stop as soon as the first occurrence is found.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_64bqiogy\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"All paragraphs containing 'Пончик'\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"maxElements\\\":1000,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1266,\"completion_tokens\":306,\"total_tokens\":1572}}\n",
