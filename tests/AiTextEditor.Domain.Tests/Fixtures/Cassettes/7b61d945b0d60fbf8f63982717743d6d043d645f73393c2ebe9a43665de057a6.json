The user wants to find a paragraph where Znayka compares the lunar surface to a well-baked blini (which is a type of Russian pancake) and explains the bubbles. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows that there are already 2 pieces of evidence, but the recent pointers are 11:1.1.1.p8 and 12:1.1.1.p9. However, the current batch starts from pointer 23:1.1.1.p20 onwards. The user's task is to find new evidence in the current batch, so I should ignore the previous pointers.\\n\\nLooking through each item in the batch:\\n\\n- The first item (23:1.1.1.p20) talks about lunar inhabitants moving inside the moon, comparing it to a rubber ball, but no mention of blini or bubbles.\\n- The next items (24:1.1.1.p21 to 28:1.1.1.p25) discuss the book's controversy and the professor's critique. Still no relevant content.\\n- Item 29:1.1.1.p26 to 31:1.1.1.p28 are dialogue between Znayka and the professor. Not relevant yet.\\n- Item 32:1.1.1.p29: Znayka mentions flying in a rocket and observing weightlessness. Still not the comparison.\\n- Item 33:1.1.1.p30: Professor scoffs at weightlessness. Not relevant.\\n- Item 34:1.1.1.p31: Here, Znayka talks about the water in the bottle during weightlessness. The water spreads out, forming a bubble. He compares the bottle to a planet, but the user's task mentions blini. Wait, the user's task says \\\"лунная поверхность с хорошо пропечённым блином\\\" (lunar surface compared to a well-baked blini). But in the excerpt, Znayka compares the bottle to a planet, not blini. However, maybe there's a confusion here. The user might have a typo, or perhaps the original text has a different comparison. Alternatively, maybe the blini is part of the explanation about the bubbles. Wait, the user's task says \\\"сравнивает лунную поверхность с хорошо пропечённым блином и объясняет пузырьки пара\\\" (compares lunar surface to a well-baked blini and explains the bubbles). \\n\\nLooking again, in the excerpt from 34:1.1.1.p31, Znayka explains that when he drank half the water, the remaining water spread out, forming a bubble. He then says that this shows water is attracted to the bottle's walls, not the center. But there's no mention of blini here. The user's task might be referring to a different part. Wait, maybe the initial comparison was in a previous batch, but the current batch doesn't have that. The user's snapshot shows that previous evidence pointers are 11 and 12, which are not in the current batch. So in the current batch, there's no mention of blini. However, the user's task might have a mistake, or perhaps the answer is in the current batch. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\\n\\nWait, the user's task is to find where Znayka compares the lunar surface to a well-baked blini and explains the bubbles. In the current batch, the only relevant part is in 34:1.1.1.p31 where he talks about the water in the bottle and the bubble formation. But that's about a bottle, not blini. Unless there's a translation error. Maybe \\\"блины\\\" (blini) is used in the original text, but in the provided excerpt, it's about a bottle. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the task description. However, according to the given data, there's no mention of blini in the current batch. Therefore, the answer would be that there's no new evidence in the current batch, so the decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2237,\"completion_tokens\":919,\"total_tokens\":3156}}\n",
