The goal is to find the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The context mentions paragraphs with dialogue markers involving Znayka and the professor. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The first item is paragraph 10:1.1.1.p7, which discusses scientists debating the origin of lunar craters. There's no mention of Znayka or the professor here. \\n\\nThe second item is paragraph 11:1.1.1.p8. Here, Znayka is mentioned, but the content talks about his theory about lunar craters comparing them to a pancake's bubbles. However, there's no mention of the professor or any sarcastic comment about being stuck in the Moon's center. \\n\\nSince the task specifies that the evidence must be from the current batch and the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers are empty, I need to check if there's any mention of Znayka's sarcastic comment in these paragraphs. The provided text doesn't have any such instance. The user might be referring to a different part of the text not included here. \\n\\nSince there's no matching content in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The newEvidence array remains empty as there are no relevant pointers to add.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1109,\"completion_tokens\":299,\"total_tokens\":1408}}\n",
