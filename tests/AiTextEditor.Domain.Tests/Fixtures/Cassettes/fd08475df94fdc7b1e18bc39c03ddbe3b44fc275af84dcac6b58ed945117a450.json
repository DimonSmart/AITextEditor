The task is to find the first mention of 'профессор Звёздочкин'. The user provided a snapshot with evidenceCount 1 and recentEvidencePointers including \\\"3:1.1.1\\\". But the current batch's items don't have that pointer. The firstBatch is false, so we're in a subsequent batch. The items here are pointers 21:1.1.1.p18, 22:1.1.1.p19, 23:1.1.1.p20. \\n\\nLooking through each item's markdown. The first paragraph (21:1.1.1.p18) talks about Знайка and his theory about the Moon's crater, but no mention of профессор Звёздочкин. The second paragraph (22:1.1.1.p19) mentions Знайка again, discussing the lunar inhabitants, but still no professor. The third paragraph (23:1.1.1.p20) continues the story about the lunar inhabitants moving inside the Moon. None of these paragraphs mention 'профессор Звёздочкин'. \\n\\nSince the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"3:1.1.1\\\" which isn't in the current batch, maybe that was from a previous batch. But the current batch doesn't have any evidence for the target term. So the decision should be 'not_found' because there's no mention in the current batch items. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't stop here. Therefore, the output is 'not_found' with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1302,\"completion_tokens\":366,\"total_tokens\":1668}}\n",
