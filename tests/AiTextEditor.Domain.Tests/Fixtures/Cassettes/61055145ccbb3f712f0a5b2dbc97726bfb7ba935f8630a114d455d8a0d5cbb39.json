The user asked how the second chapter ends, and I need to answer in English.\\n\\nFirst, I used the cursor-create_cursor tool with a filter for \\\"text contains 'Chapter 2'\\\". Then ran agent-run_agent to find the end of Chapter 2. The response from the agent says the evidence is pointer 5:2.p2 with the excerpt: \\\"The second chapter ends with a cliffhanger about the hidden door.\\\" The reason given is that it mentions 'second chapter ends', so that's the concluding paragraph.\\n\\nWait, but the user wants the answer in English. The evidence says the chapter ends with a cliffhanger about the hidden door. So the answer should be that the second chapter ends with a cliffhanger involving a hidden door. Let me check if there's more to it. The status says cursor complete, so no more items. The evidence seems straightforward. The answer is that the second chapter ends with a cliffhanger about the hidden door. I need to phrase that clearly in English. Maybe \\\"The second chapter ends with a cliffhanger involving a hidden door.\\\" Or more precisely as per the evidence: \\\"The second chapter ends with a cliffhanger about the hidden door.\\\" Yes, that's exactly what the evidence says. So the final answer should be that sentence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1189,\"completion_tokens\":288,\"total_tokens\":1477}}\n",
