The user is asking to find a paragraph where Ponchik chooses a darker night and drowns his old clothes in the Ogurcovna River. First, I need to check the current batch items provided. \\n\\nLooking at the pointers and markdown content, none of the paragraphs mention Ponchik, the Ogurcovna River, or anything about drowning clothes. The existing evidence pointer from the snapshot is 6:1.1.1.p3, which isn't in the current batch's items. The current batch starts from pointer 58:1.1.1.p55 onwards, which seems to be a different part of the text, possibly from a story about weightlessness and a moon trip. There's no mention of Ponchik or the Ogurcovna River here.\\n\\nSince the task requires specific elements that aren't present in the current batch, and the previous evidence isn't in this batch either, the decision should be 'not_found'. No new evidence can be added because the necessary content isn't available here. The user might need to check other batches or confirm if the pointers are correctly referenced.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2222,\"completion_tokens\":251,\"total_tokens\":2473}}\n",
