The user is asking for the location of the fourth mention of Professor Zvezdochkin in the book, excluding headers. \\n\\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the task correctly. The user wants the fourth occurrence of the professor's name, not counting any headers. So, I should focus on paragraphs and not headings.\\n\\nEarlier steps used a keyword cursor with \\\"звёздочкин\\\" to find all mentions. The cursor was created without including headings, which is correct here. Then, batches of items were read, each time getting more paragraphs. \\n\\nLooking at the items returned from the cursor reads:\\n\\n1. The first mention is in paragraph 21 (SemanticPointer 24:1.1.1.p21) where he's introduced.\\n2. The second mention is in paragraph 22 (25:1.1.1.p22) where he proposes the discussion.\\n3. The third mention is in paragraph 23 (26:1.1.1.p23) as he starts his speech.\\n4. The fourth mention would be in the next batch. Looking at the latest response, the items include SemanticPointer 73:1.1.1.p70, which is the fourth mention. \\n\\nWait, let me check again. The first three mentions are in paragraphs 21, 22, 23. Then the next items are 25:1.1.1.p25 (fourth?), 35:1.1.1.p32 (fifth?), 37:1.1.1.p34 (sixth?), etc. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list them in order:\\n\\n- 24:1.1.1.p21 (1st)\\n- 25:1.1.1.p22 (2nd)\\n- 26:1.1.1.p23 (3rd)\\n- 28:1.1.1.p25 (4th)\\n- 35:1.1.1.p32 (5th)\\n- 37:1.1.1.p34 (6th)\\n- 42:1.1.1.p39 (7th)\\n- 50:1.1.1.p47 (8th)\\n- 51:1.1.1.p48 (9th)\\n- 52:1.1.1.p49 (10th)\\n- 70:1.1.1.p67 (11th)\\n- 71:1.1.1.p68 (12th)\\n- 73:1.1.1.p70 (13th)\\n- 74:1.1.1.p71 (14th)\\n- 76:1.1.1.p73 (15th)\\n\\nWait, but the user is asking for the fourth mention. So the fourth would be at 28:1.1.1.p25. Let me check the content of that paragraph. The item with SemanticPointer 28:1.1.1.p25 mentions \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" again. That's the fourth occurrence. \\n\\nBut in the latest tool response, the items include 73:1.1.1.p70, which is later. So the fourth mention is in paragraph 25 (p25). The user's answer should be the pointer for that paragraph. Let me confirm the count again:\\n\\n1. p21\\n2. p22\\n3. p23\\n4. p25\\n\\nYes, that's four. So the fourth mention is in SemanticPointer 28:1.1.1.p25. Therefore, the answer is that the fourth mention is in paragraph 25, which is at SemanticPointer 28:1.1.1.p25.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_nw47k9uu\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":3528,\"completion_tokens\":877,\"total_tokens\":4405}}\n",
