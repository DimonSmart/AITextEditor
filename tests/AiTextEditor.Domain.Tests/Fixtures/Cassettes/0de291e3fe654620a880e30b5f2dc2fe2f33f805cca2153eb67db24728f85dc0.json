The user wants the first mention of Фуксия and Селедочка. The task says to find the first occurrence in all paragraphs. The current batch has three items, all headings. The first is a main heading, then a subheading, then another subheading. None of these seem to mention Фуксия or Селедочка. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and recentEvidencePointers is empty. Since the batch items are all headings and don't contain the required terms, there's no evidence here. So the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the first mention isn't in this batch. Need to make sure not to include any pointers from recentEvidencePointers, which are none here. So the output is decision: not_found and no newEvidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":654,\"completion_tokens\":184,\"total_tokens\":838}}\n",
