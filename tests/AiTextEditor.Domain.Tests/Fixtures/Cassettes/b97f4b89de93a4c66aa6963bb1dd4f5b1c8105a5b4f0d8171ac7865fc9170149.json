The user wants to find a paragraph that describes the lunar crater visualization as an enormous circular field with an earth embankment along the edge. The context mentions looking for the terms 'визуализация лунного кратера', 'огромного круглого поля', and 'земляной вал по краю'. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so we need to find new evidence. The items are paragraphs from a story about the Sun City and its developments. Let me check each paragraph.\\n\\nLooking at pointer 4:1.1.1.p1, the paragraph talks about the city's changes, including rotating buildings and various vehicles. No mention of a lunar crater here. \\n\\nPointer 5:1.1.1.p2 discusses the factory and clothing production. Still not relevant. \\n\\nPointer 6:1.1.1.p3 is about Ponchik's clothes and the moth problem. Not related. \\n\\nPointer 7:1.1.1.p4 mentions the smell from the naphthalene and people avoiding Ponchik. Still no mention of the lunar crater or the required terms. \\n\\nWait, none of the paragraphs in the current batch mention 'визуализация лунного кратера' or the other keywords. The task's context specifies those exact phrases. Since the batch items don't contain any of these terms, there's no evidence to report. \\n\\nThe decision here would be 'not_found' because the required terms aren't present in the current batch. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 2, but since there's no matching content, we can't reach that. So the output should indicate that no new evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2063,\"completion_tokens\":383,\"total_tokens\":2446}}\n",
