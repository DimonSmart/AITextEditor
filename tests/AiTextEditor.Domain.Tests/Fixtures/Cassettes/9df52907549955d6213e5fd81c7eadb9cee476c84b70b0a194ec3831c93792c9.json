The user wants me to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin and describe his character trait of boiling with outrage. The context is mentions of 'профессор Звёздочкин', so I need to look for that exact name in the provided batch items.\\n\\nFirst, I'll scan through each item's markdown content. The first item (12:1.1.1.p9) talks about the Moon's surface and Znayka's theory, but no mention of the professor. The next items (13-18) discuss astronomers and Znayka's theories, but again, no professor. \\n\\nLooking at item 19:1.1.1.p16, there's a mention of Znayka being called a \\\"блинистом\\\" by the vulcanologists and meteoriticians. But that's not the professor. \\n\\nWait, item 20:1.1.1.p17 mentions that the vulcanologists and meteoriticians called Znayka a \\\"блинистом\\\" and said his theory was silly. Still no professor. \\n\\nItem 21:1.1.1.p18 talks about Znayka giving up his theory after visiting the Moon. Still no professor. \\n\\nItem 22:1.1.1.p19 mentions Znayka publishing a book about lunar inhabitants, but again, no professor. \\n\\nItem 23:1.1.1.p20 is about the lunar inhabitants moving inside the Moon. \\n\\nWait, the task is about Professor Zvezdokhin, but none of the items mention that name. The only mention is of Znayka, who is a character in the text. The user might have a typo, but assuming the task is correct, maybe I missed something. \\n\\nWait, looking again: the user's task says \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" which is \\\"Professor Zvezdokhin\\\". But in the provided items, the only mention is of \\\"Знайка\\\" (Znayka), who is a character, not the professor. There's no mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in any of the items. \\n\\nTherefore, there's no evidence to report. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the required mention isn't present in the current batch. The user might have confused Znayka with Professor Zvezdokhin, but based on the given data, there's no match. So the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2325,\"completion_tokens\":553,\"total_tokens\":2878}}\n",
