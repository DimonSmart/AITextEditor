The user wants to find a paragraph that describes the lunar crater visualization as an enormous circular field with an earth embankment along the edge. The context mentions looking for the terms 'визуализация лунного кратера', 'огромного круглого поля', and 'земляной вал по краю'. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check each item in the current batch. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, but the user is asking for up to two. Let me go through each paragraph.\\n\\nLooking at the items, the first few paragraphs (76-82) are about Zvezdokhin being dragged away and the meeting closing. Those don't seem relevant. Then there's a heading for Chapter Two and another heading for the puzzle of the lunar stone. \\n\\nThe next paragraph (85:1.2.1.p1) talks about a report in the newspaper about the discussion of Znaykina's book. It mentions that the newspapers had many cartoons, including one where a little person is hanging onto a tree. But I don't see the exact keywords here. The terms 'визуализация лунного кратера' (visualization of the lunar crater) and 'земляной вал по краю' (earth embankment along the edge) aren't present here. \\n\\nThe next item is 86:1.2.1.p2, but the sample is truncated. Since the user's input ends there, maybe there's more content. However, based on the provided text, none of the paragraphs contain all the required keywords. The existing evidence pointer is 9:1.1.1.p6, which isn't in the current batch. Wait, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"9:1.1.1.p6\\\", but the current batch starts from 76:1.1.1.p73. So maybe that evidence is from a previous batch. \\n\\nSince the current batch doesn't have any paragraphs matching the required terms, the decision would be 'not_found'. But wait, the user's task says to use only the current batch. None of the items here mention the lunar crater visualization with the specified elements. Therefore, there's no new evidence to add. The answer should be 'not_found' because the required terms aren't present in the current batch items.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1548,\"completion_tokens\":513,\"total_tokens\":2061}}\n",
