The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the current batch. First, I need to scan each item's markdown content carefully. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence with pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but the current batch items don't include that pointer. So I need to check the new items.\\n\\nLooking at the first item (39:1.1.1.p36), the markdown talks about the Moon cooling from the surface, but there's no mention of 'Фуксии'. The second item (40:1.1.1.p37) has a dialogue about molten substance, still no 'Фуксии'. The third item (41:1.1.1.p38) also discusses the liquid inside the Moon. None of these paragraphs mention 'Фуксии'. \\n\\nSince none of the current batch items contain 'Фуксии', the newEvidence array should be empty. The decision would be 'continue' because there's no new evidence to add. The user's task might require checking more batches, but based on the provided data, there's nothing here. I need to make sure not to include any pointers from the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers since the user specified to exclude those. So the final output is an empty newEvidence array with decision 'continue'.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":862,\"completion_tokens\":308,\"total_tokens\":1170}}\n",
