The user wants the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to find any occurrence of that term.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer 54:1.1.1.p51, the markdown is about flying to the Moon. No mention of Пончик here. The next item, 55:1.1.1.p52, talks about weightlessness. Still nothing. The third item, 56:1.1.1.p53, discusses the physics of space travel, including weightlessness and acceleration. Wait, the user's context says the content contains 'Пончик', but none of these paragraphs mention it. \\n\\nHmm, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first batch's items don't have Пончик. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include 6:1.1.1.p3, but that's from a previous batch. The current batch doesn't have any references to Пончик. So, according to the rules, if there's no evidence in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". But wait, the task says \\\"Find the first mention of Пончик\\\", and the context is that the content contains it. Maybe there's a typo or a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the input. Since the current batch doesn't have Пончик, the correct response is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":997,\"completion_tokens\":331,\"total_tokens\":1328}}\n",
