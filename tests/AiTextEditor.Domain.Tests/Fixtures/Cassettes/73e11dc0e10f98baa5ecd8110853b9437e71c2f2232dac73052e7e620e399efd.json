The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdochkin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided the first batch of items. Let me look through the items.\\n\\nThe first item in the batch has a pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\" and the markdown content talks about Znayka visiting the Sun City and meeting scientists Fuxiya and Selyodka. It mentions their second flight to the Moon and various activities there. However, there's no mention of Professor Zvezdochkin here. The text discusses Znayka's adventures but not the professor. \\n\\nSince the task is to find the first occurrence of Professor Zvezdochkin, and the current batch doesn't have any reference to him, I need to check if there are more batches. The batch indicates \\\"hasMore\\\": true, so there are more items to come. Therefore, I can't decide \\\"done\\\" yet because future batches might contain the mention. The evidence count is zero, so the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" to keep scanning. No evidence found in the current batch, so the newEvidence array remains empty. The correct decision here is to continue searching in the next batches.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":791,\"completion_tokens\":268,\"total_tokens\":1059}}\n",
