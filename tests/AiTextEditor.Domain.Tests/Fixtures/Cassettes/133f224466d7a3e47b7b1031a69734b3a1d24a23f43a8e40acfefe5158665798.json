The task is to find the first mention of 'профессор Звёздочкин' in the text content, excluding headers. The user provided a snapshot with evidenceCount 1 and recentEvidencePointers including \\\"4:1.1.1.p1\\\". But since the firstBatch is false and hasMoreBatches is true, we need to check the current batch's items.\\n\\nLooking at the current batch's items, all the pointers are from 8:1.1.1.p5 to 11:1.1.1.p8. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"4:1.1.1.p1\\\", which isn't in the current batch. So, the user is probably continuing from a previous batch where that pointer was found. Now, in the current batch, I need to scan each item's markdown for 'профессор Звёздочкин'.\\n\\nChecking each paragraph:\\n\\n1. Pointer 8:1.1.1.p5: The text talks about Знайка, Фуксией, Селёдочкой, and mentions the Солнечный город and Луна, but no Звёздочкин here.\\n\\n2. Pointer 9:1.1.1.p6: Mentions Стекляшкин, but not Звёздочкин.\\n\\n3. Pointer 10:1.1.1.p7: Discusses астрономы and theories about кратеры, but again, no Звёздочкин.\\n\\n4. Pointer 11:1.1.1.p8: Talks about Знайка and Стекляшкин observing the Moon, but again, no mention of Звёздочкин.\\n\\nNone of the current batch items mention 'профессор Звёздочкин'. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 1, which might refer to a previous batch's finding. Since the current batch doesn't have any matches, the decision should be 'not_found' because there's no new evidence here. The user might need to check the next batch or confirm if the snapshot's pointer was from a previous batch that's already accounted for.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1805,\"completion_tokens\":479,\"total_tokens\":2284}}\n",
