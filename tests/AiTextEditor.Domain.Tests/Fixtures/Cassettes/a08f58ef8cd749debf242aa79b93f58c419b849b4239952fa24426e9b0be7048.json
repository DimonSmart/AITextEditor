The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters, and the context mentions lines with exactly two character names followed by dialogue markers. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, the first item is a paragraph discussing lunar craters and astronomers splitting into two groups. There's no dialogue here, just exposition. The second paragraph mentions Znayka and Steklyashkin observing the Moon through a telescope. The excerpt says, \\\"Знайка, однако ж, не был согласен ни с вулканической, ни с метеор... Однажды он вместе со Стекляшкиным наблюдал Луну в телескоп...\\\" Wait, that's a paragraph, not a dialogue. There's no dialogue markers like quotes or \\\"said\\\" here. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first paragraph has no dialogue. The second paragraph mentions Znayka and Steklyashkin, but the text is a narrative, not a direct dialogue. The task requires exactly two character names followed by dialogue markers. Since there's no such instance in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The user might have expected a dialogue, but based on the given text, there's none. So the correct response is to indicate that no evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1104,\"completion_tokens\":312,\"total_tokens\":1416}}\n",
