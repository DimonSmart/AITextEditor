First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to check if the term appears in the markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", the markdown text talks about Пончик and his troubles with clothes, but there's no mention of профессора Звёздочкина here. The second item, pointer \\\"7:1.1.1.p4\\\", continues the story about Пончик and the moth problem. Again, no sign of профессора Звёздочкина. \\n\\nSince the task specifies to exclude headers and the provided items are both paragraphs, I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden mentions. But after a thorough check, the term doesn't appear in either of the paragraphs. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and the recentEvidencePointers are empty. Since there are no matches in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". No new evidence to add here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1285,\"completion_tokens\":254,\"total_tokens\":1539}}\n",
