The user wants me to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the provided batch items. First, I need to scan each paragraph carefully. \\n\\nLooking at the first item, pointer 78:1.1.1.p75, the markdown is about Звёздочкин being startled by an impolite address. There's no mention of Фуксии here.\\n\\nNext, pointer 79:1.1.1.p76. The text mentions Звёздочкин shouting about complaining and writing to the newspaper. Still no Фуксии.\\n\\nThird item, pointer 80:1.1.1.p77. The paragraph talks about him shouting for a while and then seeing the little guys dispersed. Again, no sign of Фуксии. \\n\\nNone of the paragraphs in this batch contain the term \\\"Фуксии\\\". The snapshot's recent pointers were from previous batches, and the current batch's items don't have any matches. So, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there's no new evidence here. I need to make sure not to include any pointers from the snapshot's recent list. The output should be a JSON with decision as \\\"not_found\\\" and an empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":800,\"completion_tokens\":283,\"total_tokens\":1083}}\n",
