The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with exactly two character names followed by dialogue markers. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, the first item (12:1.1.1.p9) is a paragraph about the Moon's surface, but there are no character names or dialogue markers here. The second item (13:1.1.1.p10) mentions astronomers and vulcanologists laughing at Znayka's theory, but again, no dialogue. The third item (14:1.1.1.p11) starts with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\", which translates to \\\"Vulcanologists said:\\\". This seems like the start of a dialogue, but there's only one name here. \\n\\nWait, the task requires exactly two character names followed by dialogue markers. The current items don't have two names in a line. The first paragraph has \\\"Знайка\\\" (Znayka) but that's a single name. The third item has \\\"Вулканисты\\\" (Vulcanologists) as a group, not two individuals. So there's no line with two names and dialogue markers here. \\n\\nSince the snapshot evidence count is 0 and there's no new evidence in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The user might need to check subsequent batches for the required dialogue lines.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1091,\"completion_tokens\":330,\"total_tokens\":1421}}\n",
