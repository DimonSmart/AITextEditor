The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with two character names followed by dialogue. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items. The first item is a paragraph discussing lunar craters and astronomers splitting into two groups. There's mention of Знайка (Znayka) and Стекляшкин (Steklyashkin) observing the Moon through a telescope. But the paragraph doesn't have a dialogue format with two names followed by speech. It's more of a narrative.\\n\\nThe second item is another paragraph where Знайка is described as creating his own theory. Here, there's a part where he and Стекляшкин are observing the Moon. The text says, \\\"Однажды он вместе со Стекляшкиным наблюдал Луну в телескоп...\\\" which translates to \\\"Once he together with Steklyashkin observed the Moon through a telescope...\\\" But again, this is a narrative, not a dialogue. There's no direct speech between the two characters here either.\\n\\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The task says \\\"Lines with two character names followed by dialogue.\\\" So the format should be something like [Character1]: [dialogue], [Character2]: [dialogue], etc. But in the given paragraphs, there's no such structure. The mentions of the characters are in the context of actions or observations, not dialogues. \\n\\nSince there's no dialogue between two characters in the provided batch items, the correct decision would be \\\"not_found.\\\" The user might be expecting a dialogue, but based on the given text, there's none. Therefore, the output should indicate that no evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1102,\"completion_tokens\":388,\"total_tokens\":1490}}\n",
