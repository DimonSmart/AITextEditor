The task is to find a mention of Znayka spending about four hours on the Moon and returning due to air problems. The context is a study of Znayka's lunar expedition.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan the current batch's items. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, with pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch's items start from pointer \\\"12:1.1.1.p9\\\" onwards. \\n\\nLooking through each item's markdown content:\\n\\n- The first paragraph (12:1.1.1.p9) talks about Znayka's book about the Moon's surface being molten and cooling, but no mention of time or air issues.\\n- The next paragraphs (13-22) discuss debates between scientists and Znayka's theories about lunar craters, volcanoes, meteorites, and his eventual visit to the Moon. \\n- In paragraph 21 (1.1.1.p18), it mentions Znayka visited the Moon and saw a crater, but no duration or air problem.\\n- Paragraph 22 (1.1.1.p19) says he published a book about lunar inhabitants (lunatiks) and their air problem. It mentions that the air was decreasing, leading them to build walls and glass domes. However, this is about the past and their structures, not his own expedition's duration or return due to air issues.\\n\\nWait, the task is about Znayka's own time on the Moon. The current batch doesn't mention him staying four hours or returning because of air problems. The existing evidence from the snapshot might be from a previous batch, but the current batch's items don't have any info matching the task. So, there's no new evidence here. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the required info isn't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2019,\"completion_tokens\":430,\"total_tokens\":2449}}\n",
