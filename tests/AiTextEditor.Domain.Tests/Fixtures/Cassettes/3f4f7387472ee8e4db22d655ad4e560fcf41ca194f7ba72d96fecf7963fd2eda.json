The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided a batch of items, and I need to scan through them.\\n\\nFirst, I'll go through each item in the batch. The first item is a heading, so I can skip that. The next items are also headings, so those are excluded as per the task. Then there's a paragraph (pointer 4:1.1.1.p1) that mentions \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" in the heading. Wait, no, the heading here is \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\", which is a heading, so according to the task, we should exclude headers. So that's not counted. \\n\\nLooking at the paragraphs, the first paragraph (pointer 4:1.1.1.p1) doesn't mention the professor. The next paragraphs (pointers 5, 6, 7) also don't have any mention of the professor. The only mention is in the heading (pointer 3:1.1.1), but since the task says to exclude headers, that's not considered. \\n\\nWait, the user's task says to exclude headers, so even if the professor's name is in a heading, it's not counted. So in this batch, there's no paragraph that mentions Professor Zvezdokhin. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there's no evidence found in this batch. But the user's snapshot has evidenceCount 0, so maybe the answer is \\\"not_found\\\" if there are no more batches. However, the batch has hasMoreBatches set to true, so we need to continue scanning. Therefore, the correct decision is \\\"continue\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1990,\"completion_tokens\":395,\"total_tokens\":2385}}\n",
