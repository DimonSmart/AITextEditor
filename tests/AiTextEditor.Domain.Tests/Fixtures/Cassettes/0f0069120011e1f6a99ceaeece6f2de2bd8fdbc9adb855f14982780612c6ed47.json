I tried creating cursors with different filters, but each time it said \\\"not_found\\\" with more items available. Maybe the initial filters were too specific or not capturing the right patterns.\\n\\nLet me think about possible reasons. Maybe the dialog isn't in the format with colons or \\\"said to\\\". Perhaps the characters are mentioned without direct speech tags. For example, maybe it's written as \\\"John asked Mary, 'How are you?'\\\" instead of \\\"John: How are you, Mary?\\\" \\n\\nI should adjust the filter to account for different dialogue structures. Maybe include variations like \\\"X asked Y\\\" or \\\"X told Y\\\" followed by a quote. Also, ensure that the cursor checks for two named entities in the same sentence where one is speaking to the other. Let me create a new cursor with a broader filterDescription to cover these cases. \\n\\nAnother possibility is that the first occurrence is spread across multiple sentences, but the cursor is set to find it in a single paragraph. Maybe increasing the maxBytes or maxElements could help, but since the user wants the first mention, perhaps the filter needs to be more lenient. \\n\\nI'll try creating a new cursor with a filter that looks for any sentence containing two named characters in a conversational context, regardless of the exact structure. This should capture more variations of dialogue and ensure that the first instance is found.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_oejwo335\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"Identifies paragraphs containing any form of dialogue (direct or indirect) between two named characters (e.g., 'Alice says to Bob...', 'John asked Mary...', or 'They discussed...').
