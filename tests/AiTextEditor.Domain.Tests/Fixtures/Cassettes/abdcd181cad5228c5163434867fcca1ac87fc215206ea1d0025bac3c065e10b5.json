The user wants the first mention of Znayka's sarcastic remark about the professor's claim regarding hanging around the Moon's center. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The task specifies that the evidence must be from the current batch, so I'll ignore any previous evidence.\\n\\nLooking at the items, the key is to find where Znayka makes a sarcastic comment. The context mentions the professor's claim about hanging around the Moon's center. Wait, the user's task is about Znayka's remark regarding the professor's claim about hanging around the Moon's center. But in the provided text, I need to check if there's a mention of Znayka's sarcastic remark related to that specific claim.\\n\\nLooking through the paragraphs:\\n\\n- The first mention of Znayka is in paragraph 12:1.1.1.p9, but that's about his book discussing the Moon's surface. \\n- Paragraph 13:1.1.1.p10 says astronomers laughed at his theory. \\n- Then paragraphs 14-23 discuss debates between volcanologists and meteoritologists. \\n- In paragraph 20:1.1.1.p17, there's a mention of Znayka being called a \\\"блинист\\\" (blini guy) by others, and they mock him by comparing the Moon to a pancake. But the task is about a sarcastic remark regarding the professor's claim about hanging around the Moon's center. \\n\\nWait, the user's task mentions \\\"hanging around the Moon's center,\\\" but in the provided text, I don't see any mention of that specific claim. The closest is the part where Znayka's theory is mocked as a \\\"blini\\\" theory, but that's about the Moon's surface being like a pancake, not about hanging around the center. \\n\\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The task's context is about Znayka's sarcastic remark about the professor's claim regarding hanging around the Moon's center. But in the given batch items, there's no mention of the professor's claim or Znayka's remark about hanging around the Moon's center. The only mentions are about his theories about the Moon's surface and the debates with other scientists. \\n\\nTherefore, there's no evidence in the current batch that matches the task's requirement. The answer should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required mention isn't present here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2337,\"completion_tokens\":541,\"total_tokens\":2878}}\n",
