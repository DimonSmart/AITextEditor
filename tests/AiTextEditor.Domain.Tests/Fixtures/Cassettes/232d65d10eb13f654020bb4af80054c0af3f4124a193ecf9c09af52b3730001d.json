The user is asking where in the text it's mentioned that Znayka stayed on the Moon for about four hours and had to return urgently due to air issues. \\n\\nFirst, I need to find the relevant section. The assistant already created a keyword cursor with the keywords \\\"знайка,\\\" \\\"луна,\\\" \\\"четыре,\\\" \\\"час,\\\" \\\"воздух.\\\" Then they read the first batch, which included some headings and a paragraph about the Sun City. The paragraph doesn't mention Znayka or the Moon, so that's not it.\\n\\nThe next step is to continue reading batches from the cursor. The next batch might have the relevant information. Let me check the next items. The cursor is named keyword_cursor_0, and the previous batch ended at \\\"4:1.1.1.p1.\\\" The next batch would start after that pointer. \\n\\nI need to call cursor-read_cursor_batch again with the same cursor name. The response might include the paragraph where Znayka's story is discussed. If the paragraph mentions staying on the Moon for four hours and air issues, that's the answer. If not, continue reading more batches. Since the user mentioned \\\"воздух\\\" (air), maybe there's a part about air running out, leading to an urgent return. \\n\\nI should keep reading batches until the relevant paragraph is found. If after a few batches the information isn't there, maybe the answer is in a later section. But given the step limit, I need to be efficient. The answer is likely in one of the subsequent paragraphs under the heading \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\" (How Znayka Defeated Professor Zvezdokhin). Let's check the next batch.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_do5q81t1\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1750,\"completion_tokens\":399,\"total_tokens\":2149}}\n",
