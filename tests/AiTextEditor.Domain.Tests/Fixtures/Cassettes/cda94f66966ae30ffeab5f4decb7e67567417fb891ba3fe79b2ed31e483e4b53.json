The task is to find the first mention of профессор Звёздочкин in the text, excluding headers. The snapshot shows that there are already 2 pieces of evidence, with pointers 24:1.1.1.p21 and 70:1.1.1.p67. But those are from previous batches, so I need to check the current batch's items.\\n\\nLooking at the current batch's items, the pointers start from 76:1.1.1.p73 onwards. The user mentioned that the firstBatch is false, so this is not the first batch. The hasMoreBatches is false, so this is the last batch. \\n\\nNow, I need to scan each item in the current batch. Let's go through each paragraph:\\n\\n1. Pointer 76:1.1.1.p73 mentions Звёздочкина being dragged out, but it's part of an action, not the first mention.\\n2. Pointer 77:1.1.1.p74 refers to him as \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" again, but it's a dialogue.\\n3. Pointer 78:1.1.1.p75 talks about Звёздочкин being confused, so that's a mention.\\n4. Pointer 79:1.1.1.p76 has him shouting about being a professor, which is the first explicit mention of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\".\\n5. The rest of the pointers either refer to him again or are headers.\\n\\nWait, the task says to exclude headers, so the heading pointers like 83:1.2 and 84:1.2.1 are ignored. The first mention in the current batch would be in pointer 79:1.1.1.p76 where he says \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\". But I need to check if there's an earlier mention in the current batch. Let me check again:\\n\\nLooking at pointer 76:1.1.1.p73, the text is about someone grabbing Звёздочкина, but it's part of a narrative. The first explicit mention of \\\"профессор\\\" would be in pointer 79:1.1.1.p76. However, the user's snapshot has previous evidence, but the current batch's items might have the first occurrence. Wait, the task is to find the first mention in the entire text, but the previous batches might have already found some. However, the current batch's items are the ones to scan now. Since the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include 70:1.1.1.p67, which is from a previous batch, but the current batch's items start at 76. So in the current batch, the first mention of профессор Звёздочкин would be in pointer 79:1.1.1.p76. But I need to check if there's an earlier mention in the current batch. Let me check each item again:\\n\\n- 76:1.1.1.p73: \\\"Звёздочкина\\\" (without \\\"профессор\\\")\\n- 77:1.1.1.p74: \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" again\\n- 78:1.1.1.p75: \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" again\\n- 79:1.1.1.p76: \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" (first mention with \\\"профессор\\\")\\n- 80:1.1.1.p77: \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" again\\n- 81:1.1.1.p78: \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" again\\n- 82:1.1.1.p79: \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" again\\n\\nSo the first mention of \\\"профессор\\\" is in 79:1.1.1.p76. But the task says to exclude headers, which are the headings. The current batch's items don't have any headers except the ones already excluded. Therefore, the first mention in the current batch is 79:1.1.1.p76. However, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include 70:1.1.1.p67, which might be from a previous batch. But the current batch's items are the ones to check. So the answer should be the pointer 79:1.1.1.p76 with the excerpt from that paragraph. The reason is that the excerpt directly mentions \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1401,\"completion_tokens\":1088,\"total_tokens\":2489}}\n",
