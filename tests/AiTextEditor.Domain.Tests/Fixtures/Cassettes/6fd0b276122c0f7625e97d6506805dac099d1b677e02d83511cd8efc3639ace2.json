We are reading backward from end of the book. The cursor is \\\u0022CUR_WHOLE_BOOK_BACKWARD\\\u0022 meaning we start from end and moving backwards; each batch given contains items in order of decreasing line index (the earlier in list likely earlier lines? Actually each batch shows items with decreasing LineIndex? Let\u0027s see first batch given: pointer line index 169 then subsequent batches have headings with line index decreasing (169, 167, 165...). So as we walk backward, we are moving from later part of book (higher line index) to earlier. So we need first occurrence encountered while walking backward, i.e., the latest occurrence in the whole book. So we need to keep scanning batches until we find a paragraph containing \\\u0022\u041F\u043E\u043D\u0447\u0438\u043A\\\u0022. So far, none of the displayed paragraphs contain that word. Continue scanning backward (the earlier parts) might contain it.\\n\\nWe only have up to line index 105 shown. Probably need to request next batch but currently we have only these. Since we must respond now, but we haven\u0027t found. According to instruction: \\\u0022Analyze each portion and respond with JSON using one of the statuses: \u0027continue\u0027, \u0027found\u0027, or \u0027complete\u0027.\\\u0022 We\u0027re supposed to respond after each portion. Since not found yet, we respond status continue with maybe empty result. So: {\\\u0022status\\\u0022:\\\u0022continue\\\u0022,\\\u0022result\\\u0022:\\\u0022\\\u0022}.\u0022},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022stop\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:7752,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:312,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:8064}}\n",
