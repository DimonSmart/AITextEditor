The goal is to find the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The context is paragraphs with dialogue markers mentioning Znayka and Professor. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence, with the pointer \\\"30:1.1.1.p27\\\". But since the current batch doesn't include that pointer, I'll focus on the new items.\\n\\nLooking at the first item: pointer 36:1.1.1.p33. The markdown here has Znayka speaking. He says, \\\"Почему же не научно?\\\" which translates to \\\"Why isn't that scientific?\\\" He's arguing that a bottle in space is weightless and behaves like a planet. The mention of the Moon being hollow is there, but does this count as sarcastic? The dialogue seems to be Znayka's explanation, not necessarily sarcastic. The task specifies sarcasm, so I need to check if there's a tone of mockery or irony here. The wording is authoritative, but not sure if it's sarcastic.\\n\\nNext, pointer 37:1.1.1.p34. Here, Zvezdочкиn agrees but asks why Znayka thought the Moon is hollow. This is a question, not a comment from Znayka. So no evidence here.\\n\\nThird item: pointer 38:1.1.1.p35. The listeners laugh, but Znayka isn't bothered. He says something, but the excerpt cuts off. The markdown ends with him saying something, but the exact words aren't provided. Since the excerpt is incomplete, maybe there's more, but based on what's given, we can't confirm.\\n\\nNow, the task mentions the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The existing evidence from the snapshot might have that, but since the current batch doesn't include that pointer, I need to check if any of these new items mention the professor. The current items don't mention the professor, so maybe the existing evidence from the snapshot is from a previous batch. However, the user is asking for the first mention in the current batch. \\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center.\\\" The current batch items don't mention the professor. The existing evidence from the snapshot might have that, but since the user is processing the current batch, perhaps the existing evidence is from a previous batch. Therefore, in the current batch, there's no mention of the professor. \\n\\nBut wait, the first item's markdown mentions the Moon being hollow. Maybe the professor is implied to be stuck there? The task says \\\"the professor being stuck in the Moon's center.\\\" If Znayka's comment about the Moon being hollow is sarcastic, implying the professor's theory is wrong, but the current batch's items don't explicitly mention the professor. \\n\\nHmm, maybe the existing evidence from the snapshot includes the professor's mention. Since the current batch doesn't have that pointer, perhaps there's no new evidence here. But the user's instruction says to scan only the current batch. So if the current batch doesn't have any mention of the professor, then there's no new evidence. \\n\\nWait, the first item's markdown says \\\"внутри Луны, в том случае, конечно, если Луна изнутри пустая.\\\" Which translates to \\\"inside the Moon, of course, if the Moon is hollow inside.\\\" This is Znayka's argument. The sarcasm might be in implying that the professor's theory is absurd. But the task requires the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck. Since the current batch doesn't mention the professor, maybe there's no new evidence here. \\n\\nBut the user's snapshot has evidenceCount 1, which might be from a previous batch. The current batch's items don't have the professor mentioned, so the newEvidence would be empty. However, the task's maxEvidenceCount is null, so we need to check if any of the current items have the required mention. Since they don't, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\" or \\\"continue.\\\" But according to the rules, if there's no new evidence, the decision is \\\"continue.\\\" \\n\\nWait, the user's output schema requires \\\"decision\\\" to be continue, done, or not_found. If there's no new evidence, then \\\"continue\\\" is appropriate. But the user's task says to find the first mention, and if the current batch doesn't have it, then the answer is \\\"not_found.\\\" But the rules say to scan only the current batch. So if none of the current items have the required mention, then the answer is \\\"not_found.\\\" \\n\\nBut looking again, the first item's markdown has Znayka's dialogue. The task is about Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck. The current items don't mention the professor, so there's no match. Therefore, the newEvidence array is empty, and the decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there's no new evidence. But the user's task might have the professor mentioned in the current batch. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. \\n\\nThe first item's markdown: \\\"Почему же не научно? – авторитетно ответил Знайка. – Когда бутылка свободно перемещается в межпланетном пространстве, она находится в состоянии невесомости и во всём уподобляется планете. Внутри её всё будет происходить так же, как внутри планеты, то есть внутри Луны, в том случае, конечно, если Луна изнутри пустая.\\\" \\n\\nThis is Znayka's explanation about the Moon being hollow. The sarcasm might be in implying that the professor's theory is wrong, but the professor isn't mentioned. Therefore, there's no mention of the professor being stuck. Hence, no new evidence. So the decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there's no new evidence, and the existing evidence is from a previous batch. \\n\\nBut the user's task says to find the first mention. If the current batch doesn't have it, then the answer is \\\"not_found.\\\" Wait, the rules say to output \\\"not_found\\\" if no evidence is found. But the user's output schema allows \\\"continue\\\" or \\\"done\\\" or \\\"not_found.\\\" So if there's no new evidence, the decision is \\\"continue.\\\" \\n\\nTherefore, the correct output is \\\"continue\\\" with an empty newEvidence array. But the user's example might have different rules. Wait, the user's instruction says to output exactly one JSON object. So if there's no new evidence, the newEvidence array is empty, and the decision is \\\"continue.\\\" \\n\\nBut the user's task might require that if the current batch has no evidence, then the answer is \\\"not_found.\\\" However, according to the rules, the decision is \\\"continue\\\" if there's no new evidence. So the correct output is:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\",\\n  \\\"newEvidence\\\": []\\n}\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":863,\"completion_tokens\":1529,\"total_tokens\":2392}}\n",
