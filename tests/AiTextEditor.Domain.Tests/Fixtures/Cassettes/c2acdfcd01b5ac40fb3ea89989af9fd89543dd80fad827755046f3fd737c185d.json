Let me start by creating a cursor to search for all paragraphs containing his name. I'll use the cursor-create_cursor function with a filter for paragraphs with 'профессор Звёздочкин'. \\n\\nAfter creating the cursor, I need to run the agent to find the first occurrence. Using agent-run_agent with the cursor name and a task description to find the first mention. The response from the tool gives an evidence item with the paragraph text. \\n\\nI should check if this paragraph is indeed the first mention. If it's part of the document's early sections, that's the answer. If not, I'll need to continue scanning by running the agent again. But since the user wants the first mention, the first evidence item from the cursor should be the correct location. I'll make sure to include the pointer label in the summary and present the answer in Russian.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_j6a4qo5m\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of профессор Звёздочкин\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1356,\"completion_tokens\":253,\"total_tokens\":1609}}\n",
