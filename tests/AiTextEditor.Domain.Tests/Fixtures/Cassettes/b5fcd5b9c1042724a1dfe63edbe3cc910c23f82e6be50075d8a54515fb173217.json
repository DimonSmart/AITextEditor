The user wants me to find the first direct dialogue between two named characters. The task says to look for paragraphs with direct dialogue, like \\\"Alice: Hello, Bob.\\\" and focus on named entities in a conversational context. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once I find one, I should set decision to \\\"done\\\".\\n\\nLooking at the input, the snapshot has evidenceCount 0 and no recent pointers. The first batch has an item with pointer \\\"1:1\\\" which is a heading. The itemType is Heading, and the markdown is \\\"# Часть I\\\". Since the task is about direct dialogue between named characters, headings probably aren't relevant here. The user mentioned to ignore headings unless the task asks for them. So this item doesn't contain any dialogue. \\n\\nSince there are no other items in the batch, and the first item is a heading, there's no evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no matching content in the current batch. Also, the user said to output exactly one JSON object. So the newEvidence array will be empty, and the decision is not_found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":622,\"completion_tokens\":249,\"total_tokens\":871}}\n",
