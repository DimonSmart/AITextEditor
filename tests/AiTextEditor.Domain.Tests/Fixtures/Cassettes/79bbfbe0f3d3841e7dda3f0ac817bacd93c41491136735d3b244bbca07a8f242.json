The user is asking about a specific description in the book: two rotating buildings on Kolokolchikov Street, with a spiral descent and a devil's wheel on the roof. I need to find where this is mentioned.\\n\\nFirst, I created a cursor with the relevant keywords: 'Колокольчиков', 'вертящихся зданий', 'спиральный спуск', and 'чёртово колесо'. The tool response came back with an evidence item. Now, I need to check if this item contains all the mentioned elements.\\n\\nLooking at the evidence, the paragraph talks about the spiral descent and the devil's wheel on the roof. However, it doesn't explicitly mention two rotating buildings. The user's query specifies two buildings, so I need to verify if the evidence item addresses that. Since the initial cursor might not have captured all keywords, maybe the mention of two buildings is in a different part of the text. \\n\\nI should run the agent again with the cursor to find the first mention, ensuring that all elements are included. The maxEvidenceCount is set to 1 to get the first occurrence. If the first item doesn't have all the details, I might need to adjust the filter or check subsequent items. But according to the tool response, the first evidence item includes the spiral descent and the devil's wheel. The user might be referring to the same description, even if the exact phrase about two buildings isn't there. Alternatively, the mention of two buildings could be in another part of the text. I need to confirm if the existing evidence covers all aspects or if more searching is required.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_4c28xaak\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of two rotating buildings with spiral descent and devil's wheel on Kolokolchikov Street\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1176,\"completion_tokens\":405,\"total_tokens\":1581}}\n",
