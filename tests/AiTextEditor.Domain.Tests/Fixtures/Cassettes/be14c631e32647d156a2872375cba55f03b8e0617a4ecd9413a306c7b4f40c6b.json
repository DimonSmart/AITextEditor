The task is to find mentions of \\\"профессора Звёздочкин\\\" (Professor Zvezdochkin). The current batch has two items: pointers 6:1.1.1.p3 and 7:1.1.1.p4.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check each item's markdown for any mention of that name. Let me read through them carefully.\\n\\nLooking at the first item (pointer 6:1.1.1.p3): The markdown talks about Пончик (Ponchik) and his clothes. It mentions him taking old suits to the river, getting new ones, and his room being full of clothes. There's no mention of a professor named Звёздочкин here. Words like \\\"Огурцовой реке\\\" (Cucumber River) but no professor.\\n\\nSecond item (pointer 7:1.1.1.p4): This one is about moths in the house because of the clothes, using naphthalene, the smell causing people to react. Again, the text is about Ponchik's situation with the clothes and the smell. No mention of any professor. The names mentioned are Пончик and коротышки (shorties), but no Звёздочкин.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should check if there's a typo or different spelling. But the task says \\\"профессора Звёздочкин\\\" which is \\\"Professor Zvezdochkin\\\". Let me check again. The first paragraph: \\\"Все были очень довольны. Единственным, кто пострадал на этом деле, оказался Пончик...\\\" No mention of a professor. The second paragraph: \\\"От такого обилия шерстяных изделий в доме развелась моль...\\\" Still no. \\n\\nSo neither of the current batch items contain the name \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" or any variation. The recentEvidencePointers from the snapshot include \\\"3:1.1.1\\\", which was already counted in evidenceCount 1. But the current batch doesn't have any matches. \\n\\nThe task's maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't have a limit. But since there are no matches in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches (hasMoreBatches is true). But wait, the output needs to check if there's new evidence. Since there's nothing in the current batch that matches, newEvidence should be empty. \\n\\nWait, the rules say: \\\"Do NOT add evidence for a pointer that appears in snapshot.recentEvidencePointers.\\\" But in this case, the current batch items don't have any matches, so newEvidence would be empty. \\n\\nSo decision: if there's no new evidence, but hasMoreBatches is true, then decision should be \\\"continue\\\". Because the agent needs to keep scanning more batches. \\n\\nBut the output must have newEvidence as an empty array. Let me check the schema. The newEvidence is a list, which can be empty. \\n\\nSo the JSON would be:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\",\\n  \\\"newEvidence\\\": []\\n}\\n\\nYes. Because there's no new evidence in this batch. The snapshot says evidenceCount is 1, but that's from previous batches. Current batch has nothing. So we continue scanning.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1292,\"completion_tokens\":712,\"total_tokens\":2004}}\n",
