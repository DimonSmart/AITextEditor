The user wants the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to find any occurrence of that exact word.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer 51:1.1.1.p48, the markdown text is about two shorties grabbing Zvezdokhin and taking him off the tribune. No mention of Пончик here. \\n\\nNext, the second item 52:1.1.1.p49 has a quote where they shout for Znayka to give a report and drive Zvezdokhin away. Still no Пончик. \\n\\nThe third item 53:1.1.1.p50 has Znayka addressing the audience, saying he can't give a report because he wasn't prepared. Again, no sign of Пончик. \\n\\nWait, the snapshot shows that evidenceCount is 1, and the recentEvidencePointers include \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". But the current batch doesn't have that pointer. The user's input might have a previous batch's evidence, but the current batch's items don't mention Пончик. So, there's no new evidence here. \\n\\nSince the task is to find the first mention and the current batch doesn't have it, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the user mentioned that if the maxEvidenceCount isn't met, we should continue. But since there's no evidence in the current batch, the answer is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":798,\"completion_tokens\":345,\"total_tokens\":1143}}\n",
