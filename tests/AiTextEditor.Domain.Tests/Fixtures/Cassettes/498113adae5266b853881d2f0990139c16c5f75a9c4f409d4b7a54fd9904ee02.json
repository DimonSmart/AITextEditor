The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item's markdown content carefully. \\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (pointer 4:1.1.1.p1), the text talks about Незнайка's trip to the Sun City and various developments there. I'll check if 'Фуксии' is mentioned here. Skimming through, I don't see that word.\\n\\nNext, the second paragraph (pointer 5:1.1.1.p2) discusses the industrial enterprises built with help from Sun City residents. Again, I'll search for 'Фуксии'. The text mentions a clothing factory by engineer Клёпки, but no 'Фуксии' here either.\\n\\nSince neither paragraph contains 'Фуксии', there are no new evidence points to add. The decision should be 'not_found' as the word isn't present in the current batch. I need to make sure not to include any pointers from the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers since they aren't part of this batch. Also, the output must be a JSON object with the decision and newEvidence array, but since there are no matches, newEvidence will be empty. Let me double-check to ensure I didn't miss any mentions. Nope, everything looks good. Time to format the response accordingly.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1256,\"completion_tokens\":306,\"total_tokens\":1562}}\n",
