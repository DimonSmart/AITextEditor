The user wants to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokin in the text, excluding headers. The task is to scan the current batch's items and extract relevant evidence.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check each paragraph in the batch. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so no previous matches. The task is about finding the first occurrence, so I have to go through each item in order.\\n\\nLooking at the items, all the paragraphs are about Znayka's theories about the Moon's surface and the lunar craters. There's a mention of Znayka being called a \\\"блинист\\\" (bliniist) by the vulcanologists and meteoriticians. But the task is about Professor Zvezdokin, not Znayka. Wait, maybe there's a translation issue? The user might have meant Znayka as Professor Zvezdokin? Or perhaps there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the name is different in the original text. Let me check again.\\n\\nWait, the user's task is in Russian. The original text mentions \\\"Знайка\\\" which translates to \\\"Znayka,\\\" a character from a Russian children's book. The user might have confused the name with Professor Zvezdokin. But in the provided text, there's no mention of Professor Zvezdokin. All references are to Znayka. So maybe the task has a mistake, or perhaps the user intended to refer to Znayka as Professor Zvezdokin. However, according to the given data, there's no mention of Professor Zvezdokin. Therefore, the answer would be \\\"not_found\\\" because the current batch doesn't have any evidence of Professor Zvezdokin. But the user's task says to exclude headers, and all the items here are paragraphs. Since there's no mention of the professor, the correct decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2083,\"completion_tokens\":414,\"total_tokens\":2497}}\n",
