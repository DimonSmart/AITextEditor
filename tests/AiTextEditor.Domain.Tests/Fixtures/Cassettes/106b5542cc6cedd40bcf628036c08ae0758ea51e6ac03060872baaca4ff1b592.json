The user is asking where in the document it's mentioned that Znayka stayed on the Moon for about four hours and had to return urgently due to air issues. \\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out the right keywords to search for. The main elements here are \\\"Знайка,\\\" \\\"Луна,\\\" \\\"четыре часа,\\\" and \\\"воздух.\\\" Since the user mentioned \\\"четырёх часов,\\\" I should use the stem \\\"четыре\\\" to cover variations. Also, \\\"воздух\\\" is crucial here because the return was due to air problems.\\n\\nI'll start by creating a keyword cursor with these terms. The function call uses \\\"cursor-create_keyword_cursor\\\" with the keywords in lowercase stems. The includeHeadings is set to true to ensure headings are included. \\n\\nNext, I'll read the cursor batches to find the relevant paragraph. The response from the tool gives a batch with a pointer. I need to check if the paragraph at that pointer mentions all the required elements: Znayka's time on the Moon, the four hours, and the air issue. \\n\\nLooking at the provided text, the paragraph mentions Znayka staying on the Moon for four hours and having to return because of air. That's exactly what the user is asking for. So the answer is in that paragraph, and the stop reason is goal_reached.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_u32y8v6r\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1249,\"completion_tokens\":321,\"total_tokens\":1570}}\n",
