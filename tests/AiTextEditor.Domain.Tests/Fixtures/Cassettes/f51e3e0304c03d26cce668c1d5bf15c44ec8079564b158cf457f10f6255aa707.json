The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and there are no recent evidence pointers. The first batch has items that are all headings. \\n\\nLooking at the items in the batch: the first is a main heading, then a subheading, and another subheading. None of these are paragraphs, and they don't contain any dialogue. The task specifies to look for paragraphs with named characters in dialogue. Since the current batch only has headings, there's no evidence here. The user might be expecting the next batch to have actual content, but since the first batch doesn't, I should return that there's no evidence found. The decision here is \\\"not_found\\\" because the required content isn't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":658,\"completion_tokens\":197,\"total_tokens\":855}}\n",
