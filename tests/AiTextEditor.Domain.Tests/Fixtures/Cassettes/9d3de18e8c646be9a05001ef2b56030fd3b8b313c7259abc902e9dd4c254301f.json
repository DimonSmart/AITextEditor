The user is asking for the second mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the book, excluding headers. First, I used the keyword cursor to find all instances of \\\"Zvezdokhin\\\". Then, I ran the chat cursor agent to get the second occurrence. But the response said there's no second mention. Maybe there's only one instance, or maybe the first one is a header. I should check if the initial search missed something. Perhaps the professor's name is mentioned in a header, which the user wants to exclude. Alternatively, maybe the name is spelled differently in the text. I need to confirm if the cursor correctly filtered out headers. If the answer says \\\"end\\\", it means the cursor reached the end without finding the second mention. So the answer is that there's no second mention beyond the first one, possibly because the first is a header or there's only one instance. I should present this in Russian as the final answer.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1263,\"completion_tokens\":248,\"total_tokens\":1511}}\n",
