The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with exactly two character names followed by dialogue markers. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, both are paragraphs. The first paragraph talks about Nезнайка's journey and other characters like Кнопочки and Пачкули Пёстренького, but there's no dialogue here. The second paragraph mentions Жители Солнечного города helping with construction, but again, no dialogue markers. \\n\\nSince the task requires dialogue between two characters with their names followed by markers, and neither paragraph has that, there's no evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required dialog isn't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1268,\"completion_tokens\":184,\"total_tokens\":1452}}\n",
