Let me start by creating a cursor to search through all paragraphs. I'll use the \\\"search_cursor\\\" with a filter for all paragraphs to make sure I don't miss any mentions. Now, I need to run the agent to find the first occurrence of these names.\\n\\nFirst, I'll call the agent with the task to find the first mention of Фуксия and Селедочка. The agent will process the document in portions, so I might need to run it multiple times until it finds the relevant paragraph. I should check each evidence item returned to see which one contains the first mention. If the first item has both names, that's where they are introduced. If not, I'll continue scanning the next portions until the cursor completes or the names are found. Once found, I'll note the pointer and provide the answer in Russian.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_8oqnptcw\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of Фуксия and Селедочка\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1337,\"completion_tokens\":246,\"total_tokens\":1583}}\n",
