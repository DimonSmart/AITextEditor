Also in p37: \\\"– Ещё не остывшее расплавленное вещество! – закричал кто-то из слушателей.\\\" This says \\\"someone from the listeners\\\" but not a specific name. The term \\\"кто-то\\\" is not a person name; does that count as a character mention? Probably need specific person. The task says \\\"every paragraph where a person appears\\\". \\\"someone\\\" could be considered a person, albeit unspecified, but likely they want explicit characters. In previous evidence they included paragraphs with characters likely named. p36 has no character name, it's a narration. So only p38 includes \\\"Знайка\\\".
