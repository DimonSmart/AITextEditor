The task is to find a paragraph where Ponchik chooses a darker night and drowns his old costumes in the Ogurcovy River. The user provided a snapshot with evidence count 1 and a recent pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". But the first batch's items start from pointer 8:1.1.1.p5 onwards. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check the current batch's items. The pointers here are 8,9,10,11. The snapshot's recent pointer is 6, which isn't in the current batch, so maybe that's from a previous batch. The user's instruction says to only use the current batch's content.\\n\\nLooking at the markdown of each item:\\n\\n8:1.1.1.p5 talks about Znayka's trip to the Sun City, meeting Fuxiya and Selodka, building a rocket, and traveling to the Moon. No mention of Ponchik or the Ogurcovy River.\\n\\n9:1.1.1.p6 is about Znayka's return and discussing lunar craters. Still no relevant info.\\n\\n10:1.1.1.p7 discusses the debate between volcanic and meteorite theories for lunar craters. Not related.\\n\\n11:1.1.1.p8 describes Znayka's own theory about lunar craters, comparing them to pancakes. Still no Ponchik or river mentioned.\\n\\nNone of the current batch items mention Ponchik, the Ogurcovy River, or the action described. The snapshot's recent pointer was from a previous batch, which isn't included here. Since the current batch doesn't have any evidence, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1702,\"completion_tokens\":378,\"total_tokens\":2080}}\n",
