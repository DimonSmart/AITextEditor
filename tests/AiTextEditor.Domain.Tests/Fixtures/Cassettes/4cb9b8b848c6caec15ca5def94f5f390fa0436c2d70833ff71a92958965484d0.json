The user wants the first mention of Ponchik throwing old costumes into Ogurcovna River. The context is paragraphs mentioning both Ponchik and Ogurcovna River. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 1, and the recentEvidencePointer is \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". But the current batch items don't include that pointer. Let me check each item in the batch.\\n\\nFirst item: pointer 18:1.1.1.p15. The markdown talks about lunar craters and meteorites, no mention of Ponchik or the river. Second item: 19:1.1.1.p16, same topic, no relevant terms. Third item: 20:1.1.1.p17, still discussing volcanologists and meteoritists, not Ponchik or the river. None of these items mention Ponchik or Ogurcovna River. So there's no new evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the current batch doesn't have any relevant pointers. Also, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointer isn't in this batch, so no need to exclude anything. Since there's no match, output \\\"not_found\\\" with empty newEvidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":914,\"completion_tokens\":277,\"total_tokens\":1191}}\n",
