The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that we should look for paragraphs with direct speech markers like quotes or dashes. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once we find one, we can stop.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, there are two paragraphs. The first one (10:1.1.1.p7) talks about astronomers arguing about the origin of lunar craters, but there's no direct dialogue here. It's more of a description of their debate without any quotes or dialogue indicators.\\n\\nThe second paragraph (11:1.1.1.p8) mentions Znayka and Steklyashkin observing the Moon. However, the text describes their observations and Znayka's theory about the craters resembling a pancake's surface. There's no direct dialogue between them here either. The conversation is implied through their actions, but there's no actual quoted speech or dialogue markers like dashes or quotes.\\n\\nSince neither paragraph contains direct speech between named characters, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The user might need to check subsequent batches for such dialogues. But based on the current batch, there's no evidence to meet the task requirements.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1098,\"completion_tokens\":271,\"total_tokens\":1369}}\n",
