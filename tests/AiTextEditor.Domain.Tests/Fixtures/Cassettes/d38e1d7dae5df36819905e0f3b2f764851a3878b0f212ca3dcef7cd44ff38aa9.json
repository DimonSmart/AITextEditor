The task is to find a description where astronomers in the Solar City argued and split into volcanists and meteoritists. First, I need to scan through the current batch items to find any mentions of such a conflict.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, the items are mostly paragraphs from a story involving characters like Znayka, shorties, and Professor Zvezdochkin. The context seems to be a narrative about a space trip and experiences in a zero-gravity environment. \\n\\nI need to check if there's any mention of astronomers arguing and splitting into two groups. The snapshot's recent evidence pointers don't include any from this batch, so I need to look through all the items here. \\n\\nLooking through each paragraph:\\n\\n- The first few paragraphs describe physical sensations in zero gravity, like losing weight and floating. No mention of arguments or groups.\\n- Later paragraphs involve interactions between characters, like the shorties asking questions about the water in the bottle and the moon rock. There's a part where the professor, Zvezdochkin, criticizes the lack of discussion about Znayka's book, but that's more about a meeting's agenda than a split between groups.\\n- The story mentions different characters but not specifically astronomers. The term \\\"astronomers\\\" isn't used here. The conflict mentioned in the task isn't present in the current batch's content. \\n\\nSince none of the items in the current batch mention astronomers arguing and splitting into volcanists and meteoritists, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\". There's no relevant evidence here to add to the newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2275,\"completion_tokens\":346,\"total_tokens\":2621}}\n",
