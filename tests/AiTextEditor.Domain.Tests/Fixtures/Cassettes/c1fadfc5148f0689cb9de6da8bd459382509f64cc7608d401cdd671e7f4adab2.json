Actually they are two mentions of the phrase \\\u0022\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\\\u0022 in that paragraph: one preceded by \\\u0022\u0422\u043E\u043B\u044C\u043A\u043E\\\u0022 and later after \\\u0022..., \u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D \u0432\u044B\u0441\u043A\u043E\u0447\u0438\u043B...\\\u0022 So the first occurrence in the whole book might be earlier in text. We haven\u0027t seen it yet. We need second occurrence overall. Need to count occurrences from start of book. Since we haven\u0027t seen any previous occurrence yet, the first occurrence could be earlier in the part not yet provided. However we need second occurrence. The paragraph we have now contains two mentions. If previous part had one earlier, then the first mention in this paragraph might be the second overall, or the second mention could be third overall. We need to be careful.\\n\\nWe don\u0027t have earlier parts. The task: find the second occurrence of that phrase in the book. The system expects to scan sequentially; we must continue until we locate second occurrence. Likely earlier occurrence appears before this paragraph, perhaps earlier in the same chapter. Let\u0027s continue scanning more. The next portions after this may include further. But we might have missed first occurrence earlier than line 139. Let\u0027s ask: The earlier part of book might have introduced professor earlier. The sections earlier about \\\u0022\u041A\u0430\u043A \u0417\u043D\u0430\u0439\u043A\u0430...\\\u0022 didn\u0027t include professor. So maybe the first occurrence is also later, maybe earlier in this same paragraph after \\\u0022\u0422\u043E\u043B\u044C\u043A\u043E\\\u0022. That would be the first occurrence? Wait the phrase appears twice in that paragraph. If there were no earlier instances, the first occurrence is \\\u0022\u0422\u043E\u043B\u044C\u043A\u043E \u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D \u0431\u044B\u043B...\\\u0022 That\u0027s the first. Then second is later \\\u0022\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D \u0432\u044B\u0441\u043A\u043E\u0447\u0438\u043B...\\\u0022 So the second occurrence overall might be that second mention in same paragraph. The requirement: \\\u0022return the exact line text where it appears, plus two lines before and after. Include line numbers.\\\u0022 So we need the line containing second occurrence. But need line numbers relative to whole document. The cursor gives line indexes: line 139 is where the paragraph starts? Actually each pointer has LineIndex values like 139. So the paragraph containing mentions is at line index 139. So the line containing second occurrence is same line (139) because the paragraph is a single line? It might be wrapped but our data shows the paragraph text includes both mentions, we can\u0027t separate lines. But we can assume each paragraph is a line. So need two lines before and after: line indices 137,138, then 140,141. We have pointers for 137 (line 137 text), 138? We have 137 and 139. There\u0027s also 138? Not shown yet. Possibly 138 is missing. Let\u0027s see: we have lines: 135, 137, 139. There\u0027s a gap 136,138 maybe earlier. We can request more. But we have to respond now with JSON containing status \u0027continue\u0027 if we need more context (need lines before and after). We need to fetch lines 136,138,140,141. So we don\u0027t have them yet. Therefore we should continue.\\n\\nThus status: continue. Provide result detail that we need more lines.\u0022},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022stop\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:2461,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:828,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:3289}}\n",
