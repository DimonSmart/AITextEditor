The task is to find the first mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" in the given batch. First, I need to scan through all the items in the batch to see if any of them contain that exact phrase.\\n\\nLooking at the pointers, each item is a paragraph. The user mentioned that the snapshot has an evidence count of 0 and no recent evidence pointers, so I need to check all items here. Let me go through each paragraph's markdown content.\\n\\nStarting with pointer 12:1.1.1.p9. The text talks about Знайка and the Moon's surface, but there's no mention of профессор Звёздочкин here. Next, pointer 13:1.1.1.p10 mentions astronomers and vulcanologists laughing at Знайкина theory. Still no professor. \\n\\nContinuing to pointer 14:1.1.1.p11, the vulcanists are quoted. Then pointer 15:1.1.1.p12, the same vulcanists are mentioned again. Pointer 16:1.1.1.p13, Знайка responds to vulcanists. Still no sign of the professor. \\n\\nPointer 17:1.1.1.p14 mentions meteoritologists. Pointer 18:1.1.1.p15, they argue against volcanoes. Pointer 19:1.1.1.p16, Знайка's response about meteorites. Pointer 20:1.1.1.p17, the vulcanists and meteoritologists dismiss Знайка, calling him a \\\"блинист\\\". \\n\\nPointer 21:1.1.1.p18, Знайка gives up his theory after visiting the Moon and sees the crater. Pointer 22:1.1.1.p19, he publishes a book about lunar inhabitants, the лунатики. Pointer 23:1.1.1.p20, the лунатики moving inside the Moon. \\n\\nWait, none of these paragraphs mention \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". The task is to find the first mention, but in all the provided items, there's no reference to that name. The context is about Знайка and discussions about the Moon's features, but not the professor. \\n\\nSince the snapshot's evidence count is 0 and the current batch doesn't have any mentions of профессор Звёздочкин, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". There's no new evidence to add here. So the output should reflect that no evidence was found in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2271,\"completion_tokens\":589,\"total_tokens\":2860}}\n",
