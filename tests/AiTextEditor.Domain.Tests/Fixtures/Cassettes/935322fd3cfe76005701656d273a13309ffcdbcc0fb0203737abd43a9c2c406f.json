The user is asking where it's described how the astronomers in the Sun City got into a fight and split into volcanologists and meteoritologists. The previous steps used a keyword cursor with keywords like \\\"астрономы\\\", \\\"солнечном\\\", \\\"разделились\\\", \\\"вулканисты\\\", \\\"метеоритчики\\\". The first batch of results didn't mention anything about astronomers fighting or splitting into those groups. The paragraphs talk about the city's changes, new buildings, and factories, but not the conflict between the groups.\\n\\nSince the initial search didn't find the answer, I need to continue reading the next batches. The cursor hasn't reached the end yet, so I should call cursor-read_cursor_batch again with the same cursor name. Maybe the relevant paragraph is in the next batch. I'll keep doing this until the answer is found or all batches are processed. If the answer isn't there, I'll have to inform the user that it's not mentioned in the provided text.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_9pwvlmze\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2013,\"completion_tokens\":242,\"total_tokens\":2255}}\n",
