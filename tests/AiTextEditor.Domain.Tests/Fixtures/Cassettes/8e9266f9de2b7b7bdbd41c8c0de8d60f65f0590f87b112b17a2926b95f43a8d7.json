The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. The context mentions paragraphs with at least two named characters. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence, with the pointer \\\"11:1.1.1.p8\\\". But since the user is providing a new batch, I need to check the current items.\\n\\nLooking at the first item in the batch, pointer 12:1.1.1.p9. The markdown here talks about Знайка (Znayka) writing a book about the Moon's surface. But there's no dialogue here, just a narrative. The next item is 13:1.1.1.p10, which mentions astronomers and vulcanologists laughing at Znayka's theory. Still no dialogue. The third item is 14:1.1.1.p11, starting with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\" which translates to \\\"Vulcanologists said:\\\". This seems like the start of a dialogue, but it's only one side. The task requires a dialogue between two named characters. Since the snapshot's evidence is from a previous batch, and the current batch doesn't have any dialogues with two named characters, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the user mentioned that if maxEvidenceCount isn't provided, we don't stop. So, no new evidence here. Hence, the output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new entries.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1092,\"completion_tokens\":329,\"total_tokens\":1421}}\n",
