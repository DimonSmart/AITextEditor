The user wants me to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokin and rewrite the paragraph, adding that the apples started to bloom at that moment.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned \\\u0022\u043D\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0438 \u043F\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043E\u0435 \u0443\u043F\u043E\u043C\u0438\u043D\u0430\u043D\u0438\u0435\\\u0022 which means \\\u0022find the first mention.\\\u0022 Looking at the tools provided, the CursorAgentPlugin-RunCursorAgent seems relevant here. It allows launching a cursor agent with a task description. The mode can be FirstMatch, which is perfect for finding the first occurrence.\\n\\nSo, I\u0027ll set the mode to FirstMatch and the taskDescription to \\\u0022Find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokin.\\\u0022 The cursorName should be something like \\\u0022ZvezdokinCursor.\\\u0022 Also, the user wants the paragraph rewritten with the addition about apples blooming. Once the first mention is found, I might need to use CursorAgentPlugin-CursorNext to get the next chunk, but maybe the RunCursorAgent with FirstMatch mode will handle it.\\n\\nWait, the RunCursorAgent\u0027s mode FirstMatch is supposed to stop at the first match, so that should give me the paragraph where Professor Zvezdokin is first mentioned. Then, I can take that paragraph and add the part about the apples blooming. But how do I get the actual text? Maybe the cursor agent will return the content, and then I can process it. However, the functions listed don\u0027t include a way to retrieve the content directly. The CursorNext function might be needed to get the next chunk, but without knowing the cursor name, it\u0027s tricky.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the RunCursorAgent with FirstMatch mode will return the required paragraph. Then, I can append the apple part. But the functions here are for creating cursors, running agents, etc. The user might expect me to use these functions to navigate through the data and then edit the paragraph. However, the actual text retrieval isn\u0027t covered in the functions provided. Maybe the user is assuming that the cursor agent will handle the content retrieval as part of the task.\\n\\nSo, I\u0027ll proceed by using RunCursorAgent with mode FirstMatch and taskDescription as specified. The cursorName could be \\\u0022ZvezdokinCursor.\\\u0022 Then, once the first mention is found, the agent should return the relevant paragraph, and I can edit it by adding the apples blooming part. The includeContent parameter in CreateCursor might be important to include the markdown content. Wait, the user might need to have the content included in the responses. So, when creating the cursor, setting includeContent to true would ensure the content is part of the responses.\\n\\nTherefore, the steps would be: create a cursor with includeContent true, then run the agent in FirstMatch mode to find the first mention. Then, take that paragraph and add the apple part. But since the functions don\u0027t include an edit function, maybe the user expects the assistant to generate the rewritten paragraph after finding the first mention via the cursor agent. So, the function calls would be to create the cursor and run the agent. However, the user\u0027s query is in Russian, and the assistant needs to process it. So the answer would involve using the RunCursorAgent function with the correct parameters.\\n\u0022,\u0022tool_calls\u0022:[{\u0022id\u0022:\u0022call_505zkhor\u0022,\u0022index\u0022:0,\u0022type\u0022:\u0022function\u0022,\u0022function\u0022:{\u0022name\u0022:\u0022CursorAgentPlugin-RunCursorAgent\u0022,\u0022arguments\u0022:\u0022{\\\u0022cursorName\\\u0022:\\\u0022ZvezdokinCursor\\\u0022,\\\u0022maxSteps\\\u0022:100,\\\u0022mode\\\u0022:\\\u0022FirstMatch\\\u0022,\\\u0022taskDescription\\\u0022:\\\u0022Find the first mention of \u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D and note the moment when apples began to bloom.\\\u0022}\u0022}}]},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022tool_calls\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:694,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:744,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:1438}}\n",
