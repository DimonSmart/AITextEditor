The task is to find the second mention of Professor Zvezdokhin, excluding headers. The user provided a snapshot with evidenceCount 0 and no recent pointers, so we start fresh. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the current batch's items. The first item is a heading, so I'll skip that. The next items are paragraphs. Let me check each paragraph for mentions of Professor Zvezdokhin.\\n\\nLooking at paragraph 4 (pointer 4:1.1.1.p1), there's a mention of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" in the heading \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". Wait, but the task says to exclude headers. So even though this is a heading, the actual mention is in the heading text. But the user specified to exclude headers, so maybe this isn't counted. However, the heading's markdown is part of the item, but the itemType is Heading. The task says to exclude headers, so this might not count.\\n\\nNext, paragraph 5 (pointer 5:1.1.1.p2) doesn't mention Zvezdokhin. Paragraph 6 (pointer 6:1.1.1.p3) also doesn't. Paragraph 7 (pointer 7:1.1.1.p4) doesn't either. Wait, but the heading \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\" is part of the items, but since it's a heading, maybe it's excluded. However, the actual mention is in that heading. But the task says to exclude headers, so maybe this isn't considered. \\n\\nWait, the user's task says \\\"исключая заголовки\\\", which translates to excluding headers. So any mention in a heading is excluded. Therefore, the first mention might be in that heading, but since it's a header, it's excluded. So the first mention isn't counted. Then, looking through the paragraphs, there's no other mention of Zvezdokhin. Therefore, there's no second mention. But the user's task says to find the second, so maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the heading's markdown is considered part of the content? Or maybe the heading's text is part of the content even though it's a header. The user's instruction says to exclude headers, so the heading's text isn't considered. Therefore, there are no mentions in the current batch. So the answer would be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no second mention. But the user's task might have a different setup. Wait, maybe the first mention is in the heading, but since it's excluded, the second mention isn't found. Therefore, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2338,\"completion_tokens\":601,\"total_tokens\":2939}}\n",
