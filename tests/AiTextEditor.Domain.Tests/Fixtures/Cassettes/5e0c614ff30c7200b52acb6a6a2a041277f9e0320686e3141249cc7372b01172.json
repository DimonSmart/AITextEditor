The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the provided batch. First, I need to scan each item's markdown content carefully. \\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (21:1.1.1.p18), the text talks about lunar craters and bricks but doesn't mention Фуксии. The second paragraph (22:1.1.1.p19) discusses lunar inhabitants called лунатики and their structures, still no Фуксии. The third paragraph (23:1.1.1.p20) continues the story about moving inside the Moon, again no mention of Фуксии.\\n\\nWait, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch items don't have any pointers with 'Фуксии'. All the markdown texts here are about the Moon's inhabitants and their structures, not Фуксии. So there's no evidence in the current batch that matches the task. Therefore, the decision should be 'not_found' since there are no new evidences to add.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1294,\"completion_tokens\":261,\"total_tokens\":1555}}\n",
