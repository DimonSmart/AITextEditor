The user is asking where Professor Zvezdochkin first appears in the text and wants a brief description of his character, specifically mentioning that he \\\"boiled with indignation.\\\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search for mentions of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" and \\\"кипел от негодования.\\\" The cursor should scan through the document, looking for these keywords. Since the user wants the first occurrence, I'll set the cursor to find the earliest mention.\\n\\nI'll use the cursor-create_cursor function with a filter that includes both keywords. The maxBytes and maxElements are set to reasonable limits to ensure the cursor can process the document in chunks. The cursor name is \\\"search_cursor\\\" to keep track.\\n\\nNext, I'll run the agent on this cursor to find the first instance where these terms appear. The agent will process the document in portions, and since we're looking for the first mention, the first evidence item should contain the answer. \\n\\nOnce the agent returns the result, I'll check the pointerLabel and the excerpt to confirm the paragraph where Professor Zvezdochkin is introduced. The description of his character, particularly his indignation, should be in that same paragraph. If the first item has both mentions, that's the answer. If not, I'll need to check subsequent items until the first occurrence is found. \\n\\nI'll make sure to include the semantic pointer in the answer and provide a concise summary in Russian, ensuring that the answer is based on the document's content and not any external knowledge.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_reqkr79v\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of профессор Звёздочкин with кипел от негодования\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1378,\"completion_tokens\":379,\"total_tokens\":1757}}\n",
