The user wants the first mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" with \\\"кипел от негодования\\\". But looking at the provided batch items, the paragraphs don't mention either of those terms. The first paragraph talks about astronomers arguing about lunar craters, and the second one is about Znayka's theory. There's no sign of Professor Zvёzdotkin or someone boiling with anger here. Since the snapshot's evidence count is 0 and the recent pointers are empty, I need to check if there's any possible match. But based on the given data, there's nothing that fits. So the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required terms aren't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1121,\"completion_tokens\":174,\"total_tokens\":1295}}\n",
