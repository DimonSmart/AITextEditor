The user wants the first mention of 'визуализация лунного кратера' described as 'огромного круглого поля с земляным валом по краю'. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so we need to find the first occurrence in the current batch.\\n\\nLooking at each item's markdown content. The first few paragraphs (76 to 82) are about Zvezdочкиn and the tribune, but no mention of the lunar crater visualization. \\n\\nThen, item 83 is a heading for chapter two. Item 84 is another heading about the lunar stone puzzle. Item 85's paragraph mentions a report about the discussion of Znaykina's book and talks about the Moon's interior. However, there's no mention of 'визуализация лунного кратера' here. \\n\\nItem 86's paragraph is truncated, so maybe the description is there. But since the user provided only up to item 86, and the excerpt is cut off, I can't confirm. Wait, the task says to use only the current batch. Since the current batch's items up to 86 don't have the exact terms, maybe there's no match. \\n\\nWait, the user's input includes the batch items. Let me check again. The markdown for item 85 mentions \\\"визуализация лунного кратера\\\" in the context of the report. Wait, no, the paragraph says \\\"отчёт о состоявшемся обсуждении Знайкиной книги\\\" and talks about the Moon's interior. But the exact phrase 'визуализация лунного кратера' isn't present here. \\n\\nLooking again, maybe the description 'огромного круглого поля с земляным валом по краю' is in one of the paragraphs. The first mention of the lunar crater visualization might be in the description of the Moon's interior. However, none of the provided excerpts include the exact terms. \\n\\nSince the user's input ends at item 86, and the excerpt is truncated, there's no evidence here. Therefore, the decision would be 'not_found' because the required terms aren't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1558,\"completion_tokens\":504,\"total_tokens\":2062}}\n",
