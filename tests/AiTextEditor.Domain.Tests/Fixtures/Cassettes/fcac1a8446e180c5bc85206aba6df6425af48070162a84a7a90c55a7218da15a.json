The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided a batch of text, and I need to scan through it.\\n\\nLooking at the current batch, the only item is a paragraph starting at pointer 11:1.1.1.p8. The markdown content talks about Znayka and his theory about lunar craters. Wait, the paragraph mentions Znayka, but the task is about Professor Zvezdokin. Hmm, maybe there's a translation or name variation here. Let me check again. The paragraph mentions \\\"Знайка\\\" which is Znayka, not Zvezdokin. The user's task is about Zvezdokin, so this paragraph doesn't mention him. \\n\\nSince the batch doesn't have any mention of Zvezdokin, and the evidence count is zero, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there might be more batches to check. The user hasn't reached the last batch yet, so scanning should continue. No evidence found here, so the newEvidence array remains empty. The decision is \\\"continue\\\" as per the rules.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":737,\"completion_tokens\":258,\"total_tokens\":995}}\n",
