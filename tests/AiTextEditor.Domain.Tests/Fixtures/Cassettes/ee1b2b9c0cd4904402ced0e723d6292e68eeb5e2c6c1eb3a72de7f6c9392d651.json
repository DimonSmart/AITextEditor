Let me start by creating a cursor to find all mentions. I'll use the mcp-create_cursor function with the description looking for mentions of Professor Zvezdokhin, making sure to exclude headers. \\n\\nNow, after creating the cursor, I need to run the agent to get the first mention. Using mcp-run_agent with the cursor name and task to find the first mention. The response came back with the first mention in paragraph 1.2.1, which is the first occurrence.\\n\\nNext, I need to find the second mention. I'll run the agent again, this time asking for the next mention. The tool response shows that the second mention is in paragraph 1.2.2. The user wants the location, so I should note the pointer label here. Since the user asked for the second mention, and the cursor has more results, I should check if there's a third mention as well. But the user specifically asked for the second, so once I have that, I can stop. The answer should include the pointer label from the second mention.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_34sy27eb\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the second mention of профессора Звёздочкина (excluding headers)\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":946,\"completion_tokens\":294,\"total_tokens\":1240}}\n",
