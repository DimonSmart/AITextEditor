Let me start by creating a cursor to find all instances where the text contains 'профессора Звёздочкина' and ensure they're not in headings. The cursor is named search_cursor.\\n\\nNow, I need to run the agent to get the first occurrence. Using run_agent with the cursor and setting maxEvidenceCount to 1 to get the first mention. The response gives the first paragraph mentioning him. Since the user wants the second mention, I should run the agent again without limiting the count. This time, it returns the next paragraph which is the second mention. I'll check the pointers to make sure it's the correct one and then present the answer in Russian with the pointer label.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_79iupig5\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":2,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the second mention of профессора Звёздочкина\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1139,\"completion_tokens\":221,\"total_tokens\":1360}}\n",
