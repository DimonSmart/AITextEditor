The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with character names followed by dialogue markers. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, the first item is a paragraph discussing the Moon's surface, but there's no dialogue here. The second paragraph also doesn't have any dialogue. The third paragraph starts with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\" which translates to \\\"Volcanologists said:\\\". This seems like a dialogue marker, but it's only one side of the conversation. There's no second character mentioned here. \\n\\nSince the task requires a dialog between two named characters, and the current batch doesn't have a complete dialogue (only one side), there's no evidence to report. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and the recentEvidencePointers are empty. So, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no matching dialog in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1089,\"completion_tokens\":222,\"total_tokens\":1311}}\n",
