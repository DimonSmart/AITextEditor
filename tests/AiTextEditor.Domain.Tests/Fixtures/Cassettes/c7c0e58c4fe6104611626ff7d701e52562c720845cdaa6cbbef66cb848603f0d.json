The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the current batch. First, I need to check each item's markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item, pointer 18:1.1.1.p15, the markdown talks about lunar craters not being volcanoes or pancakes. No mention of Фуксии here.\\n\\nNext, pointer 19:1.1.1.p16 mentions meteorites leaving circular or oval marks, but again, no Фуксии. \\n\\nThe third item, pointer 20:1.1.1.p17, discusses volcanologists and meteoritologists dismissing Znayka, calling him a \\\"блинистом\\\" (pancake person). The term here is \\\"блинистом,\\\" which is related to pancakes, but not Фуксии. \\n\\nWait, the task is to find 'Фуксии,' which isn't present in any of these excerpts. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5,\\\" but that's from a previous batch. The current batch items don't have any occurrence of Фуксии. So, there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the required term isn't present here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":902,\"completion_tokens\":292,\"total_tokens\":1194}}\n",
