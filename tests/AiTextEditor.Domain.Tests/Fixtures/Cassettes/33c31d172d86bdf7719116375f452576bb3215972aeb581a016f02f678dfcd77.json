The user wants to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokin, excluding headers. They provided a cursor name keyword_cursor_0 and a maxEvidenceCount of 1. \\n\\nFirst, I need to use the keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor function with the keywords \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" to create a cursor that finds instances of this name in the document. Since the task is to find the first occurrence, the cursor should return items in order, and the first one would be the earliest mention.\\n\\nBut wait, the user mentioned excluding headers. I should check if the cursor's filter can handle that. The keyword cursor's description says it locates keywords in the document, but maybe it includes headers. However, the user's task specifies to exclude headers, so perhaps the initial setup of the cursor needs to account for that. But since the user hasn't provided a way to filter headers, maybe the initial search will include them, and the first occurrence after that would be the correct one. Alternatively, maybe the cursor's parameters allow for some filtering, but the function's parameters only take keywords. \\n\\nWait, the user might have already set up the cursor to exclude headers. The initial task might have handled that. Since the user provided the cursor name, maybe the cursor was already created with the necessary filters. But the user's current query is to find the first mention, so using the read_cursor_batch function with the given cursor name should retrieve the first occurrence. \\n\\nSo the steps would be: call read_cursor_batch with cursorName keyword_cursor_0 to get the first batch of items. Then, check each item to ensure it's not a header. Since the user wants the first mention excluding headers, the first item that isn't a header would be the answer. But since the user specified maxEvidenceCount of 1, the agent should stop after the first relevant item. \\n\\nTherefore, the correct function to call is read_cursor_batch with the provided cursor name. That should return the first occurrence, and then the agent can process it to exclude headers if necessary. But since the user hasn't mentioned any headers in the current query, maybe the cursor already excludes them. So the answer would be the first item from the cursor.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_3w5ojq42\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"chat_cursor_tools-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":924,\"completion_tokens\":490,\"total_tokens\":1414}}\n",
