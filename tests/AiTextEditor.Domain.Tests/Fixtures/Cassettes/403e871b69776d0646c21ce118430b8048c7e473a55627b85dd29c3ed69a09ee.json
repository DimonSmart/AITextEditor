The user is asking for the second mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the book, excluding headers. First, I need to figure out how to approach this using the provided tools.\\n\\nI remember that the tools include creating a cursor to scan the document. The cursor allows filtering, which is necessary here. Since the user wants the second mention, I should create a cursor that filters for mentions of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\". \\n\\nWait, the cursor's filter must be stateless, so I can't track counts in the filter itself. That means I need to create a cursor that captures all instances of the professor's name. Then, using the agent to run through the cursor, I can collect the evidence items. \\n\\nBut the user wants the second mention. So, I should first create the cursor with the filter, then run the agent with maxEvidenceCount set to 2 to get the first two mentions. However, the agent might return the first two items, but I need to check if the first item has multiple mentions. \\n\\nWait, the user said \\\"excluding headers\\\", so I need to make sure that the cursor's filter doesn't include headers. The filterDescription should look for the exact text of the professor's name in the content, not in headings. \\n\\nSo, first step: create a cursor named \\\"search_cursor\\\" with filterDescription \\\"contains 'профессора Звёздочкина' in the text, not in headers\\\". Then, run the agent with taskDescription \\\"Find the first two mentions\\\" and maxEvidenceCount=2. \\n\\nOnce the agent returns the evidence items, I can check the first two items. If the first item has two mentions, then the second mention is in the same item. Otherwise, the second item would be the second mention. \\n\\nBut I need to make sure that the cursor is correctly set up to exclude headers. The filterDescription should specify that the text is in the body, not in the headings. Maybe the filter can be \\\"text contains 'профессора Звёздочкина' and not in a heading\\\". \\n\\nAlternatively, the filter might just look for the text in the content, assuming that headers are handled separately. But since the user wants to exclude headers, the filter should check that the mention is not part of a heading. \\n\\nSo, the filterDescription could be \\\"the text contains 'профессора Звёздочкина' and the element is not a heading\\\". That way, the cursor only includes paragraphs where the name appears, not in headers. \\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, running the agent with maxEvidenceCount=2 should give the first two mentions. Then, the answer would be the second item in the evidence list, or the second mention within the first item if there are multiple. \\n\\nI need to make sure that the agent's output is checked for the exact mentions. If the first item has two mentions, then the second mention is in the same item. Otherwise, the second item is the second mention. \\n\\nSo, the steps are: create the cursor, run the agent with maxEvidenceCount=2, then check the evidence items to find the second mention. Then, return the pointerLabel and the text.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_a42vdd5y\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"text contains 'профессора Звёздочкина' and not in a heading\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":10485760,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1069,\"completion_tokens\":732,\"total_tokens\":1801}}\n",
