Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search for mentions of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". The function mcp-create_cursor seems right for this. I'll set the name as \\\"search_cursor\\\" and the description to look for the professor's name. Since they want the first mention, I should start from the beginning of the document.\\n\\nWait, the user said to exclude headings. So when the cursor finds a match, I need to make sure it's not a heading. The function mcp-run_agent will help iterate through the document. I'll run the agent with the cursor and task to find the first mention. \\n\\nOnce the agent finds a match, I should check if it's part of the text or a heading. If it's a heading, I need to continue searching. But the user wants the first occurrence in the text, so maybe the first match found by the cursor is the right one. However, I should verify that the pointerLabel isn't a heading. \\n\\nIf the first result is a heading, I'll have to keep running the agent until I find a paragraph that mentions him. But the user wants the first mention, so maybe the initial search will get the correct paragraph. Let me proceed step by step. Create the cursor, run the agent, and check the result. If it's a heading, continue; otherwise, return that paragraph.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_a1pgc7do\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"description\\\":\\\"Mentions of профессор Звёздочкин (excluding headings)\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":714,\"completion_tokens\":362,\"total_tokens\":1076}}\n",
