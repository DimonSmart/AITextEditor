The task is to find the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The context is paragraphs with dialogue markers mentioning Znayka and Professor. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 2, and recent pointers are 30:1.1.1.p27 and 43:1.1.1.p40. But the current batch has items 48:1.1.1.p45, 49:1.1.1.p46, 50:1.3.1.p47.\\n\\nLooking at the batch items: \\n\\nItem 48: \\\"– Верно! Правильно! Молодец, Знайка! Ура!\\\" This is a dialogue, mentions Znayka, but it's praise, not sarcasm. The professor isn't mentioned here.\\n\\nItem 49: \\\"Все захлопали в ладоши. Кто-то крикнул:\\\" No mention of Znayka or professor here. Just a crowd clapping and someone shouting. Doesn't fit the context.\\n\\nItem 50: \\\"– Долой Звёздочкина!\\\" Again, dialogue, mentions Zvёzdочкин (professor's name?), but no Znayka here. So no mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor's situation.\\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center.\\\" The current batch items don't have any mention of the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The previous evidence pointers (30 and 43) might have that, but the current batch doesn't. So in the current batch, there's no evidence that matches the task. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because none of the current items provide the required evidence. The user needs to check other batches.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":740,\"completion_tokens\":429,\"total_tokens\":1169}}\n",
