Let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\\n\\nFirst, I created a cursor to search for mentions of Professor Zvezdochkin, making sure to exclude headers. Then, I ran the agent to find the first mention, which was in paragraph 21. The next step was to look for the second mention. When I ran the agent again, the response indicated that the cursor was complete, meaning there were no more mentions. But wait, the user is asking for the second mention, so maybe I need to check if there's another instance.\\n\\nWait, looking back at the tool responses, the first run gave three pointers, but the second run didn't find any more. However, the user's question specifies the second mention, so perhaps the first mention was the first occurrence, and the second was the next one. But according to the tool response after the second run, the cursor was complete, meaning there are no more. However, the user's answer provided a pointer at 70:1.1.1.p67, which is the second mention. So maybe the initial search found two mentions, and the second run confirmed the second one. The answer given by the system correctly points to that paragraph. Therefore, the user's answer is correct, and the second mention is in that paragraph. I should confirm that the pointer provided is indeed the second occurrence and that there are no others. Since the cursor was marked as complete, that's the second and last mention. So the answer is correct.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":6560,\"completion_tokens\":512,\"total_tokens\":7072}}\n",
