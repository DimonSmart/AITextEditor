The user wants to find the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the provided batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence, but the pointer given is \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". However, the current batch items start from pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\" and \\\"9:1.1.1.p6\\\". \\n\\nFirst, I need to check each item's markdown content for the exact mention of \\\"Пончик\\\". Let me look at the first item's markdown: it talks about Знайка, Фуксией, Селёдочкой, and their trip to the Moon. There's no mention of Пончик here.\\n\\nThe second item's markdown discusses the Moon's surface, craters, and the astronomer Стекляшкин. Again, no sign of Пончик. \\n\\nSince neither of these paragraphs mention Пончик, and the snapshot's recent evidence pointer is from a previous batch (which isn't included here), the current batch doesn't have any new evidence. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no mention in the current batch items. The user might need to check subsequent batches, but based on the given data, there's nothing here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1309,\"completion_tokens\":288,\"total_tokens\":1597}}\n",
