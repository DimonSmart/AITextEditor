The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that dialogues are indicated by markers like quotes or dashes. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once we find one, we should stop.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, both paragraphs are in Russian. The first paragraph talks about Ponchik and his actions, but there's no dialogue here. The second paragraph continues the story, mentioning Ponchik's situation with the moths and the smell. Still, I don't see any direct dialogue between two characters here. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first paragraph has Ponchik thinking about his clothes, but no quotes or dashes indicating speech. The second paragraph describes his actions and the reactions of others, but again, no dialogue. \\n\\nSince there's no evidence of dialogue between named characters in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The user might need to check subsequent batches for the dialogue.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1281,\"completion_tokens\":223,\"total_tokens\":1504}}\n",
