The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that dialogues are indicated by quotes or dashes. The first batch has two paragraphs. Let me check each one.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (4:1.1.1.p1), it's a narrative about Незнайка's journey and the changes in Цветочный город. There's no dialogue here; it's all descriptive. The second paragraph (5:1.1.1.p2) talks about the industrial developments and the factory. Still, it's a narrative without any direct speech. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me scan again. The first paragraph mentions Незнайка, Кнопочки, and Пачкули Пёстренького, but those are names of characters, not dialogues. The second paragraph refers to инженера Клёпки, but again, no dialogue markers. \\n\\nSince there are no quotes, dashes, or any dialogue indicators in either paragraph, there's no evidence here. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and recentEvidencePointers is empty. The task requires finding the first dialogue, but the current batch doesn't have any. So the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no applicable evidence in the current batch. The user might need to check subsequent batches.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1265,\"completion_tokens\":297,\"total_tokens\":1562}}\n",
