The user wants me to scan the provided batch of text for matches related to the task. But wait, the task isn't specified here. The initial instructions mention that I should identify matches for the 'task', but the user hasn't given any details about what the task is. Hmm, maybe the task was mentioned in a previous batch or context that I'm missing? Since the user is asking to scan the current batch, I need to check if there's any evidence in this batch that matches the task.\\n\\nLooking at the output schema, the decision can be 'continue', 'done', or 'not_found'. The user mentioned that if found, return 'success' with evidence. Wait, the example output uses 'success' but the schema says 'done' for when the answer is determined. Maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me recheck the instructions.\\n\\nThe user's message says: \\\"If found, return decision='success' with evidence.\\\" But the schema specifies 'done' as the decision when the answer is determined. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. To be safe, I should follow the schema's 'done' decision when applicable. However, the user's instruction says to return 'success' if found. This is confusing. \\n\\nWait, looking back, the user's initial message says: \\\"IMPORTANT: Scan the batch. If found, return decision='success' with evidence. Output the JSON command at the end.\\\" But the schema provided earlier has 'done' as an option. Maybe the user intended 'success' as the decision. However, the schema's example shows 'done' as the correct decision. This is conflicting. \\n\\nSince the user explicitly says to return 'success' if found, but the schema says 'done', I need to resolve this. Perhaps the user made a typo and meant 'done'. Alternatively, maybe 'success' is a valid decision. But according to the schema, the allowed decisions are 'continue', 'done', or 'not_found'. So 'success' isn't in the schema. Therefore, the correct approach is to use 'done' when the answer is determined. \\n\\nBut the user's instruction says to return 'success' if found. This is conflicting. To comply with the user's instruction, maybe I should use 'success' as the decision. However, the schema doesn't include it. This is a problem. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended 'done' as the correct decision. Since the schema is the official guide, I should follow that. Therefore, if evidence is found, the decision should be 'done'. \\n\\nBut the user's message says to return 'success' if found. This is confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. To proceed, I'll assume that the correct decision is 'done' when evidence is found. \\n\\nNow, looking at the current batch. The user hasn't provided the actual text to scan. The example in the initial message shows a JSON with 'pointer', 'excerpt', and 'reason'. Since there's no actual text provided, I can't find any matches. Therefore, the decision would be 'continue' because there's no evidence found. \\n\\nWait, but the user's instruction says to return 'success' if found. Since there's no text to scan, the answer is 'not_found' if it's the last batch. But the user hasn't indicated if this is the last batch. The initial instructions mention 'batch.lastBatch=true' for 'not_found'. Since the user hasn't provided the batch data, I can't determine if it's the last batch. \\n\\nIn this case, without any text to scan, the correct decision is 'continue' because there's no evidence found, and we need to keep scanning. Therefore, the JSON output would have 'decision': 'continue' and an empty 'newEvidence' array. \\n\\nBut the user's instruction says to return 'success' if found. Since there's no text, maybe the answer is 'not_found'. However, without knowing if it's the last batch, it's safer to 'continue'. \\n\\nSo, the final JSON would be:\\n{\\n  \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\",\\n  \\\"newEvidence\\\": []\\n}\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":341,\"completion_tokens\":886,\"total_tokens\":1227}}\n",
