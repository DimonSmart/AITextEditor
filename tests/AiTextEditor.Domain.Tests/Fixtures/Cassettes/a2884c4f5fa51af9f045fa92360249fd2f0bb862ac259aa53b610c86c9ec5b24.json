Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to use the tools provided. The user mentioned using a keyword cursor for specific searches. Since the name is \\\"Звёздочкин,\\\" I should create a keyword cursor with that keyword. The function is create_keyword_cursor, and the parameters require an array of keywords. So I'll use the stem \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" to ensure it matches any inflected forms.\\n\\nWait, the user said to use word stems for matching all case endings. So the keyword should be \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" as the stem. Then, the cursor will find all instances where this keyword appears. But the user wants the first mention, so after creating the cursor, I need to read the batches and find the earliest occurrence.\\n\\nBut the tools don't have a way to get the first occurrence directly. The cursor will return items in order, so the first item in the batch would be the first mention. However, the user wants to exclude headers. So the filterDescription in the cursor should exclude headers. Wait, the create_keyword_cursor doesn't have a filter, but maybe the default cursor creation allows for filtering. Wait, the create_keyword_cursor is for locating keywords, but maybe the initial search might include headers. So perhaps I need to create a cursor that first finds the keyword and then filters out headers. But the tools don't have a way to combine both. Alternatively, maybe the initial search with the keyword will include headers, but the user wants to exclude them. So after getting the results, I need to check if the mention is in a header or not. But how to determine if a paragraph is a header? The user said to exclude headers, so maybe the headers are marked in some way, like being in a specific section or having a certain format. Since the user hasn't provided the document, I have to assume that headers are separate from the main text. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the create_keyword_cursor will return all occurrences, and then I can process them to find the first one that's not a header. But without knowing the document structure, it's tricky. However, the user's instruction says to use the keyword cursor for specific searches. So I'll proceed with creating the keyword cursor for \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" and then read the batches. The first item in the first batch would be the first mention. But if the first mention is in a header, I need to check. However, the user wants to exclude headers, so maybe the cursor's filterDescription can be adjusted to exclude headers. Wait, the create_keyword_cursor doesn't have a filter parameter. The cursor-create_cursor function has a filterDescription. So perhaps I should use the create_cursor function with a filter that excludes headers and includes the keyword. But the user said to prefer create_keyword_cursor for specific keyword searches. Hmm.\\n\\nWait, the user's instruction says: \\\"For specific keyword search, prefer create_keyword_cursor over generic create_cursor.\\\" So I should use create_keyword_cursor. But then, how to exclude headers? Maybe the headers are not part of the main text, so the keyword cursor will find the first occurrence in the main text. Alternatively, maybe the headers are not included in the search. But without knowing the document structure, I have to proceed with the keyword cursor. So I'll create a keyword cursor with \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" and then read the batches. The first item in the first batch would be the first mention. Then, I can check if it's in a header. But since I can't see the document, I have to assume that the cursor will return the correct paragraphs. \\n\\nSo the steps are: create a keyword cursor for \\\"Звёздочкин\\\", read the batches, and find the first occurrence. Then, return the pointer. But the user wants the answer in Russian and include the semantic pointer. So the final answer would be the pointer location where the first mention is found. \\n\\nWait, the user also mentioned that the answer might be in a previous step, so I need to check previous evidence. But since this is the first query, there's no previous evidence. So proceed with creating the keyword cursor.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_i8a3jhc0\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"Звёздочкин\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1089,\"completion_tokens\":914,\"total_tokens\":2003}}\n",
