The user wants me to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The task says to look in paragraphs with dialogue markers like quotes or dashes. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once I find one, I should set decision to \\\"done\\\".\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, the items are all headings. The first item is a main heading, then a chapter heading, and then a section heading. None of these are paragraphs with dialogue. The user mentioned that the context includes paragraphs with dialogue markers, but the current batch only has headings. Since there's no actual paragraph content here, there's no evidence to extract. \\n\\nThe snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty. Since the batch doesn't have any paragraphs with dialogue, I can't add new evidence. So the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no matching content in the current batch. I need to make sure not to include any pointers from the recentEvidencePointers since they're not in this batch. Also, the user emphasized using only the current batch's content, so I can't reference anything from previous batches. Therefore, the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":658,\"completion_tokens\":264,\"total_tokens\":922}}\n",
