The task: Find the earliest printed source that mentions the word \\\u0022\u0444\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u044F\\\u0022 as a color name. Provide year, source title, author (if given), short excerpt.\\n\\nThe cursor content is from a book, not likely containing the answer. The system is giving sequential portions of a linear document cursor and we need to scan for the occurrence of the word \\\u0022\u0444\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u044F\\\u0022 as a color name. The given portions so far are all about the fictional story; they mention a character named \u0424\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u044F (Fuksiya) but that\u0027s a name, not a color name. So far we haven\u0027t seen \\\u0022\u0444\u0443\u043A\u0441\u0438\u044F\\\u0022 as a color.\\n\\nWe need to continue scanning until we find that occurrence. Since the task is to find earliest printed source, might be outside this book; maybe the dataset includes many sources; but we have only this current document. Possibly later in this document there will be some bibliographic info about colours. Need to continue fetching next portions.\\n\\nWe must respond with JSON status continue indicating not found yet.\\n\\nThus respond: {\\\u0022status\\\u0022:\\\u0022continue\\\u0022,\\\u0022result\\\u0022:\\\u0022Not yet found\\\u0022}\u0022},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022stop\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:13576,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:273,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:13849}}\n",
