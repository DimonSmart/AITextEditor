The user is asking where Professor Zvezdokhin is first mentioned in the book, excluding headers. So, first, I need to create a keyword cursor to find any mentions of \\\"профессор\\\" and \\\"звёздочкин\\\". The user specified to use the cursor-create_keyword_cursor tool with lowercase stems, so I'll make sure the keywords are in lowercase. Wait, the user mentioned \\\"звёздочкин\\\" with a soft sign, but maybe the document uses a different form. However, the tool's description says to use lowercase word stems to cover inflected forms. So I'll use \\\"профессор\\\" and \\\"звёздочкин\\\" as the keywords.\\n\\nNext, I'll create the cursor with those keywords and includeHeadings set to false to exclude headers. Then, I'll read the batches from the cursor. Each batch will give me the paragraphs that contain either keyword. I need to go through each batch, check the text for the first occurrence of both keywords together, since the user wants the first mention. Wait, maybe the professor's name is mentioned first, and then later the title. But the user wants the first mention, so I need to check the order. \\n\\nWait, the cursor will return paragraphs that contain either keyword. So I need to process each paragraph in order, checking if it contains \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" or the name in a way that indicates the first mention. Since the user wants the first occurrence, I should read each batch, check each paragraph, and note the first one that mentions the professor. Once found, I can stop and return that location. \\n\\nBut the tool response says the cursor is created. Now, I need to read the batches. Let's assume the first batch has the relevant paragraph. For example, if the first paragraph after headers mentions \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\", that's the answer. If not, proceed to the next batch. The user might have multiple paragraphs, so I need to read each batch until I find the first mention. Once found, the answer is the pointer from that paragraph. If no mention is found, then the answer is that the professor isn't mentioned. But the user is asking where it's first mentioned, so assuming it exists, the first occurrence in the cursor's output is the answer.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_on57y1gd\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1214,\"completion_tokens\":517,\"total_tokens\":1731}}\n",
