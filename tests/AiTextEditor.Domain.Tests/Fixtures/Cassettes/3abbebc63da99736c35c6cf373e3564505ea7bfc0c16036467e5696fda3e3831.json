Let me start by creating a keyword cursor with \\\"Fuchs\\\" as the keyword. Since the user specified \\\"Фуксия\\\" in Russian, I should check if there's a mention of that exact term. Wait, the user wrote \\\"Фуксии\\\" which is the genitive form. Maybe the document uses different forms. To cover all possibilities, I'll use the stem \\\"Fuchs\\\" and look for any occurrence. \\n\\nFirst, I need to create a keyword cursor with \\\"Fuchs\\\" as the keyword. The function is cursor-create_keyword_cursor. The parameters require an array of keywords, so I'll input [\\\"Fuchs\\\"]. Include headings is true by default. Then, I'll read batches from this cursor until I find the last mention. Since the cursor returns items in order, the last item in the final batch should be the answer. I'll keep reading batches until there are no more items left. If the last mention is in the middle of a batch, I'll need to process that batch fully. Let's start with the cursor creation.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_c5lr9sba\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"includeHeadings\\\":true,\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"fuchs\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1116,\"completion_tokens\":265,\"total_tokens\":1381}}\n",
