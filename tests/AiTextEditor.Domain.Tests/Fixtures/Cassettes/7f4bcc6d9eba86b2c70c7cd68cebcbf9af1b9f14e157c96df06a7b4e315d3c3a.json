The task is to find the second mention of Professor Zvezdokhin, excluding headers. The user provided a snapshot with evidenceCount 0 and no recent pointers. The current batch has several paragraphs, but none mention Professor Zvezdokhin. The paragraphs discuss Znayka's theories about the Moon's surface, volcanic activity, meteorite impacts, and the lunar inhabitants. There's no reference to a professor here. Since the evidenceCount is 0 and the batch doesn't have any relevant content, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there's no new evidence to add. Also, since there are more batches coming, we can't set \\\"done\\\" yet. No need to use the snapshot's evidenceCount here because the task is about finding a specific mention, and the current batch doesn't have it. So, the correct output is \\\"continue\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2431,\"completion_tokens\":202,\"total_tokens\":2633}}\n",
