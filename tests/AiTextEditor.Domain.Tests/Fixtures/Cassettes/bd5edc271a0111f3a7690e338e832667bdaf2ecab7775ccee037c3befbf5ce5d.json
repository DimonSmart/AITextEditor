We have been given lines from 49 onward. Need to continue fetching earlier lines. We need to request more items possibly with previous cursor? The cursor is forward, so earlier lines have already passed. Maybe we need to request backward? Not given. Could request more but with has more true still, but we are at later indices. Need line 47, which is before line 49. Use backward direction? Perhaps the system supports moving backwards. We can request with same cursor but maybe specify no direction? Not sure. Probably need to request previous items: use same cursor but maybe it will continue forward from current position, not give earlier lines. To get earlier lines, need to request earlier portion: maybe set cursor to previous part? Not clear.\\n\\nMaybe line 47 is in earlier part not yet delivered. We should ask for more items earlier by using a new request? The interface likely expects us to continue until we find line 47. So we need to keep getting items; maybe the system will return earlier lines after we request more? Actually forward cursor goes forward, so line 47 is earlier than 49, so we have missed it. Could be that line 47 will appear after we continue because line numbers are relative to heading, not whole document? But line index 47 may be after 49 if there are other headings? Unlikely.\\n\\nNevertheless, we can respond with continue, indicating we haven\u0027t found line 47 yet.\u0022},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022stop\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:5554,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:343,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:5897}}\n",
