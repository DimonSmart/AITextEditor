However the request: \\\"Где в книге второе упоминание профессора Звёздочкина? (исключая заголовки)\\\". So they want the location (pointer) of the second occurrence. The evidence shows first paragraph (pointer 24:1.1.1.p21) contains two mentions, but that counts as first and second mentions within same paragraph? The question: second mention in the book overall, excluding headings. We need to count occurrences sequentially across the text. Evidence shows paragraph with two mentions, so the first mention is the first, second mention is also in same paragraph. So the second occurrence pointer is same as that paragraph. However we must verify if earlier paragraphs before 24:... contain any mention. Since we started cursor maybe from start, but not sure. We got pointer 24... The cursor likely started at beginning. The evidence includes that paragraph with two mentions, and then next paragraph with two mentions. Since the second occurrence may be the second mention in the first paragraph or the first mention in second paragraph? Let's count: In paragraph 24..., the text includes \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" then later \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". That's two. So the second occurrence is the second mention within that same paragraph. So pointer is 24:1.1.1.p21.\\n\\nThus answer: второе упоминание находится в параграфе 21 главы 1.1.1 (pointer 24:1.1.1.p21).
