The user wants the first mention of a lunar crater described as 'огромного круглого поля с земляным валом по краю'. The task is to find this in the provided batch items.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check each item in the batch. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and recentEvidencePointers is empty. The batch has three items, all headings. The first item is a main heading, then a subheading, then another subheading. \\n\\nLooking at the markdown content of each item: the first is \\\"# Часть I\\\", which translates to \\\"Part I\\\". The second is \\\"## Глава первая\\\", meaning \\\"Chapter One\\\". The third is \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\", which is \\\"How Znayka Defeated Professor Zvezdokhina\\\". \\n\\nNone of these headings mention a lunar crater or the specific description given. The task's context is about paragraphs mentioning lunar craters or their features, but all the items here are headings, not paragraphs. Since there's no content in the batch that matches the criteria, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, since there are no new evidence pointers to add, the newEvidence array remains empty. The decision is based on the absence of relevant content in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":677,\"completion_tokens\":298,\"total_tokens\":975}}\n",
