The user wants the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin being described as \\\"kipevший от негодования\\\" (boiling with anger) and a brief character description. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan the current batch's items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so no previous matches. The task is to find the first occurrence, so I need to check each item in order.\\n\\nLooking at the items, the first paragraph (4:1.1.1.p1) talks about the time since Nезнайка's trip and mentions the professor's victory, but no anger. The next paragraphs (5:1.1.1.p2, 6:1.1.1.p3, 7:1.1.1.p4) discuss the city's changes and Pончик's issues. None mention the professor's anger here.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. The third paragraph (6:1.1.1.p3) mentions Пончик's problem with clothes, but the professor isn't there. The fourth paragraph (7:1.1.1.p4) talks about Pончик's smell but again no professor. \\n\\nHmm, maybe the professor's mention is in a heading? The first heading (1:1) is \\\"Часть I\\\", then (2:1.1) \\\"Глава первая\\\", and (3:1.1.1) \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". Wait, the third heading mentions Знайка defeating the professor, but the task is about the professor being described as boiling with anger. \\n\\nWait, maybe the professor's anger is in the paragraph after the heading. Let me check again. The first paragraph (4:1.1.1.p1) says \\\"прошло два с половиной года\\\" and mentions the professor's victory, but not anger. The next paragraphs don't mention the professor at all. \\n\\nWait, maybe the professor's anger isn't in this batch. The user's task is to find the first mention, but in the current batch, there's no mention of the professor being described as boiling with anger. All the paragraphs here talk about the city's changes and Pончик's issues. The professor is mentioned in the heading (3:1.1.1) as being defeated by Знайка, but that's a heading, not a paragraph. The task requires a paragraph. \\n\\nSince the current batch doesn't have any mention of the professor's anger, the answer would be \\\"not_found\\\". But wait, the user's task says \\\"first occurrence\\\", and if this batch doesn't have it, but there are more batches, then the decision should be \\\"continue\\\". However, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and the current batch has no matches. So the correct decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there might be evidence in future batches. But according to the rules, if the task requires a first occurrence and the current batch has none, we should continue scanning. Therefore, the output should be \\\"continue\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2331,\"completion_tokens\":666,\"total_tokens\":2997}}\n",
