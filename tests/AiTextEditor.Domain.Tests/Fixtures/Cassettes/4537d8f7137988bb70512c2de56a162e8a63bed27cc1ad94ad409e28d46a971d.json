The user is asking for the second mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the book, excluding headers. \\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search for mentions of Professor Zvezdokhin. The user mentioned excluding headers, so I'll make sure the search doesn't pick up any headings.\\n\\nI'll start by using the mcp-create_cursor function with the description \\\"Mentions of Professor Zvezdokhin (excluding headers)\\\" and name \\\"search_cursor\\\". \\n\\nNext, I'll run the agent to find the first mention using mcp-run_agent. The response from the tool shows the first mention is at pointer 42:1.1.1.p39. The excerpt there mentions \\\"Professor Zvezdokhin\\\" in a conversation. \\n\\nNow, I need to find the second mention. I'll run the agent again, this time looking for the next occurrence. The next pointer in the response is 76:1.1.1.p73, which mentions Professor Zvezdokhin again in a different context. \\n\\nI should check if there are more mentions by running the agent again, but the tool response says HasMore is false, so there are no more. \\n\\nThe user asked for the second mention, so the answer should be the excerpt from pointer 76:1.1.1.p73. I'll format the response in Russian, include the semantic pointer, and make sure not to include any headers.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_tnaq2hzl\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the second mention of Professor Zvezdokhin\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":7566,\"completion_tokens\":351,\"total_tokens\":7917}}\n",
