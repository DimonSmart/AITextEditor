The goal is to find the first direct dialogue with two named characters in the same sentence. The context mentions examples like 'Alice says to Bob: Hello' or 'John: Hi, Mary!'. So, I need to look for instances where two named characters are having a direct conversation in the same sentence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, there's only one paragraph with the pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". The markdown content is in Russian, so I need to check if there's any direct dialogue here. Let me read through the text again.\\n\\nThe paragraph talks about Ponchik (Пончик) and mentions other characters like the store (магазин), but there's no direct dialogue. The sentences describe actions and thoughts but don't include any spoken words between two named characters. For example, there's a mention of Ponchik tying up his old suits and throwing them into the river, but no dialogue. \\n\\nSince the task requires direct dialogue between two named characters in the same sentence, and the provided text doesn't have any such instances, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". There's no evidence to report here. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and since there's no new evidence in this batch, the decision remains \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":923,\"completion_tokens\":283,\"total_tokens\":1206}}\n",
