The goal is to find the second mention of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\". Wait, looking at the input provided, the batch items don't seem to have any mention of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" at all. The paragraphs are about Знайка and his theories about the Moon, discussions between volcanologists and meteoritologists, and the lunar inhabitants. There's no reference to профессора Звёздочкина here. \\n\\nThe snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and recentEvidencePointers is empty. The task's maxEvidenceCount is 2, but since there's no mention of the required term in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The newEvidence array would be empty because there are no matches. So the correct output is decision: \\\"not_found\\\" and no new evidence entries.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2321,\"completion_tokens\":202,\"total_tokens\":2523}}\n",
