But the initial cursor_next failed because the cursor wasn\u0027t found. Hmm, maybe the cursor wasn\u0027t properly initialized. Wait, the user mentioned the cursor name is ZvezdokinCursor. Maybe I need to check if that cursor exists first.\\n\\nWait, the error says \\\u0022cursor not found,\\\u0022 so perhaps the cursor wasn\u0027t created or is misnamed. The user might have a typo or the cursor isn\u0027t set up correctly. Since the task requires using the ZvezdokinCursor, I should confirm that the cursor exists. If it doesn\u0027t, I can\u0027t proceed. Alternatively, maybe the user intended a different cursor name. But according to the task, the cursor is named ZvezdokinCursor. \\n\\nSince the first action was cursor_next, which failed, I need to handle this. In the mode FirstMatch, if the cursor isn\u0027t found, the agent should finish with an error. So the correct action here is agent_finish_not_found, explaining that the cursor wasn\u0027t found. That makes sense because without the cursor, we can\u0027t navigate the document. So the summary should state that the cursor ZvezdokinCursor was not found, preventing further actions.\\n\u0022},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022stop\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:245,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:303,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:548}}\n",
