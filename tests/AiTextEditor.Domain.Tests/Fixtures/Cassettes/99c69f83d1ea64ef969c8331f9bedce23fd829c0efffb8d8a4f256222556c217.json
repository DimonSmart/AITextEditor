Let me check what went wrong.\\n\\nIn the initial interaction, they provided a document and wanted me to navigate through it using the cursor_next action. They also specified the mode as FirstMatch, which means I should find the first occurrence that matches the target and then finish successfully. \\n\\nLooking back, when they first asked, I tried to use the cursor_next action but didn\u0027t include the necessary indices. The correct approach is to first request the next items using cursor_next with an empty indices array. Then, once I have the items, I can check if the target is found. If it is, I should use agent_finish_success with the firstItemIndex set to the index of the first match. If not, use agent_finish_not_found.\\n\\nIn my first response, I incorrectly used cursor_next without the required indices, which led to the malformed JSON error. Now, I need to correct this by first sending the cursor_next action with an empty indices array to retrieve the next items. Then, after processing those items, determine if the target is found and respond accordingly with the appropriate action and summary.\\n\\nSo, the next step is to send the cursor_next action with empty indices to get the initial items. Once I have those, I can check each item to see if it matches the target. If it does, I\u0027ll finish successfully with the firstItemIndex set. If not, I\u0027ll need to continue navigating until the target is found or determine it\u0027s not present.\\n\u0022},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022stop\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:195,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:331,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:526}}\n",
