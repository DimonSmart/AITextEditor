The task is to find the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the given batch. The user provided a snapshot with evidenceCount 1 and recentEvidencePointers including \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". But the current batch has items starting from pointer \\\"30:1.1.1.p27\\\". \\n\\nFirst, I need to check each item in the current batch. The pointers here are 30, 31, 32. The snapshot's recent pointer is 6, which is from a previous batch. Since the current batch's pointers are higher, they are new.\\n\\nLooking at the markdown content of each item:\\n- 30:1.1.1.p27 mentions talking about hanging in the center of the Moon. No Пончик here.\\n- 31:1.1.1.p28 has a dialogue where someone says \\\"А вы будто болтались?\\\" which is about talking, but not Пончик.\\n- 32:1.1.1.p29 talks about flying in a rocket and observing weightlessness. Still no Пончик.\\n\\nNone of the current batch items contain \\\"Пончик\\\". The snapshot's evidenceCount is 1, but the recent pointer is from a previous batch. Since the current batch doesn't have any mentions, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the user's task says \\\"first mention\\\", but since the current batch doesn't have it, we can't add new evidence. So the output is decision: not_found and no newEvidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":742,\"completion_tokens\":347,\"total_tokens\":1089}}\n",
