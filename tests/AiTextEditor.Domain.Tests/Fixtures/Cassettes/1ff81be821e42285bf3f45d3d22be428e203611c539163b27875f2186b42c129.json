There's mention of Pechkin's clothes and the smell, but no professor mentioned here. The text mentions \\\"Пончик\\\" (Pechkin) and his experiences, but not Professor Zvezdochkin. \\n\\nSince the first batch doesn't have any mention of the professor, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there might be more batches to check. The user indicated there are more batches (hasMore: true), so I need to keep scanning. No evidence found in the current batch, so newEvidence is empty. The decision is \\\"continue\\\" as the search isn't complete yet.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":780,\"completion_tokens\":226,\"total_tokens\":1006}}\n",
