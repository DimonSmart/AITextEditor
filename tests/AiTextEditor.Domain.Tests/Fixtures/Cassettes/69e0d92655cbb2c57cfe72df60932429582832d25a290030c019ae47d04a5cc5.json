The user wants the first dialogue between two named characters and their names. I created a cursor to find such paragraphs. Now, I need to run the agent to get the first occurrence.\\n\\nFirst, I'll use the agent-run_agent function with the cursor name and task description. The task is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. I'll set maxEvidenceCount to 1 to stop after the first match. \\n\\nWait, the cursor was created with the filter for dialogues between named characters. The agent should process the next portion of the document using this cursor. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. The cursorName is \\\"dialogue_cursor\\\", taskDescription is \\\"Find the first direct dialogue between two named characters\\\", and maxEvidenceCount is 1. \\n\\nI'll call the agent-run_agent function with these parameters. The response should give the first evidence item, which is the paragraph with the dialogue. Then, I'll extract the names from the dialogue and present them in Russian, including the semantic pointer if available.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_lwikt8zm\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"dialogue_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first direct dialogue between two named characters\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1206,\"completion_tokens\":265,\"total_tokens\":1471}}\n",
