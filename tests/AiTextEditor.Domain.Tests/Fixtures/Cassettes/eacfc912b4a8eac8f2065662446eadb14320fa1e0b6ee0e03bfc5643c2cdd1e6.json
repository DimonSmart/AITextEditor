The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with character names followed by dialogue markers. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, both are paragraphs. The first paragraph talks about Nезнайка's journey and other characters like Кнопочки and Пачкули Пёстренького, but there's no dialogue here. The second paragraph mentions the residents of the Sun City helping the flower city, but again, no dialogue markers. \\n\\nSince the task requires dialogue between two named characters, and the current batch items don't have any dialogue sections, there's no evidence to report. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required evidence isn't present in the current batch. Also, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and adding nothing from the current batch would keep it at 0, which is less than the maxEvidenceCount of 1. So, the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1266,\"completion_tokens\":236,\"total_tokens\":1502}}\n",
