Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to find the first occurrence of the name \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" in the text, not in any headings. Since the book is in Russian, I should make sure to use the correct keywords. The name \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" includes both the title and the surname, so using that as the keyword should help.\\n\\nThe user mentioned excluding headers, so I need to create a cursor that filters out headings. The cursor-create_keyword_cursor function allows specifying keywords and whether to include headings. By setting includeHeadings to false, I can ensure that only the main text is searched.\\n\\nWait, but the function parameters for cursor-create_keyword_cursor have includeHeadings as a boolean. So I should set that to false. The keywords array should include \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" in its base form. Since the system normalizes inflections, I don't need to worry about different forms of the name.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe a full scan cursor would be better to ensure all paragraphs are checked, but since the user wants the first mention, a keyword cursor should efficiently find it. Let me proceed with creating a keyword cursor with the name as the keyword and includeHeadings set to false.\\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, I can read the batch to get the first occurrence. If the cursor returns the paragraph, I can then provide the semantic pointer. If not, maybe a full scan is needed. But the keyword cursor should suffice here.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_9864qs2a\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"includeHeadings\\\":false,\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1501,\"completion_tokens\":376,\"total_tokens\":1877}}\n",
