The user is asking about Фуксия and Селедочка, specifically who they are and where they are first mentioned. First, I need to figure out how to approach this using the provided tools.\\n\\nThe user mentioned using a QA assistant for a markdown book, so the tools are probably related to searching through a document. The plan is to create a cursor with keywords and read batches. The keywords here are \\\"Фуксия\\\" and \\\"Селедочка\\\". Since the user wants the first mention, I should look for the earliest occurrence.\\n\\nWait, the tools have cursor-create_keyword_cursor which takes an array of keywords. The function uses logical OR, so any paragraph containing either keyword will be matched. But since the user wants the first mention, maybe I need to find the earliest occurrence of both names. However, the question is about who they are and where they are first mentioned, so maybe the first mention is in the same paragraph or different ones.\\n\\nI should create a keyword cursor with both names as keywords. Then read batches until I find the relevant paragraphs. The answer might be in the first batch, but I need to check each batch until I find the information. Also, the user might have mentioned them in different parts of the document, so I can't assume it's in one place.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider is that the names are in Cyrillic, so the keywords should be in lowercase stems. But the function parameters take the keywords as strings, so I should input them as \\\"фуксия\\\" and \\\"селедочка\\\" to match any inflected forms. Wait, the function says to use lowercase word stems, so maybe converting the names to lowercase stems. But the names are proper nouns, so maybe they don't have inflected forms. However, the function's note says to provide lowercase stems to cover inflected forms, so perhaps using \\\"фуксия\\\" and \\\"селедочка\\\" as the keywords.\\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, reading batches will give the paragraphs containing either keyword. Then, I need to check those paragraphs to find the first mention and their descriptions. The answer should include their identities and the first mention location.\\n\\nI should also check if there's a need to use a filtered cursor, but the user specified to use the keyword cursor for specific searches. So the correct approach is to create a keyword cursor with the two names, read batches, and then find the relevant information in the text.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_b8nnbtb0\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"includeHeadings\\\":true,\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"фуксия\\\",\\\"селедочка\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1141,\"completion_tokens\":545,\"total_tokens\":1686}}\n",
