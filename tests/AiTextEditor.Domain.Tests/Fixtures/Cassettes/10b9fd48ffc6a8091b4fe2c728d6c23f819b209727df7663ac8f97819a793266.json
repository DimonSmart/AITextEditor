The task is to check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different. Then return the names and the dialogue text.\\n\\nFirst, I need to look at the current batch items. The batch has three paragraphs. Let's check each one.\\n\\nFirst item: pointer \\\"48:1.1.1.p45\\\", markdown is \\\"– Верно! Правильно! Молодец, Знайка! Ура!\\\". The markdown starts with a dash, which is a hyphen, not a colon. The text here is \\\"Верно! Правильно! Молодец, Знайка! Ура!\\\" So it's a dialogue, but does it start with a character's name followed by a colon? The dash might be used as a dialogue marker, but the actual name here is \\\"Знайка\\\" but it's in the middle of the sentence. The start is \\\"– Верно...\\\", so the first character is a dash, then space, then \\\"Верно\\\". So the name \\\"Знайка\\\" is part of the dialogue but not at the beginning followed by a colon. So maybe this is a quote from someone else, but the paragraph itself doesn't start with a name and colon.\\n\\nSecond item: pointer \\\"49:1.1.1.p46\\\", markdown \\\"Все захлопали в ладоши. Кто-то крикнул:\\\". This is a regular paragraph. It starts with \\\"Все захлопали...\\\", no dash or colon at the start. The colon is at the end of \\\"Кто-то крикнул:\\\", but the paragraph itself doesn't start with a name followed by colon. So maybe this is setting up a quote, but the actual quote would be in the next paragraph.\\n\\nThird item: pointer \\\"50:1.1.1.p47\\\", markdown \\\"– Долой Звёздочкина!\\\". Again starts with a dash, then \\\"Долой Звёздочкина!\\\". So similar to the first one. The name here is \\\"Звёздочкина\\\", but again, the paragraph starts with a dash, not a name followed by colon.\\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So maybe the dash is considered similar to a colon? But the structure here is that the paragraph starts with a dash, then the dialogue. But the name isn't at the start followed by colon. For example, if it was \\\"Знайка: Верно!...\\\" then that would fit. But in the current items, the paragraphs start with a dash, then the dialogue text. So maybe the dash is used as a dialogue indicator, but the name isn't part of the start. For example, maybe the actual speaker is indicated by the dash, but the name isn't there. Like in some formats, a dash is used for dialogue without the name, but sometimes names are included.\\n\\nWait, looking at the first paragraph: \\\"– Верно! Правильно! Молодец, Знайка! Ура!\\\" So the dash is the start, then the text. The name \\\"Знайка\\\" is mentioned in the text, but not at the beginning followed by colon. Similarly, the third paragraph: \\\"– Долой Звёздочкина!\\\" — the name \\\"Звёздочкина\\\" is part of the dialogue, but the paragraph starts with a dash, not the name.\\n\\nSo maybe the task is looking for something like \\\"Name: text\\\", but in the current batch, there's no such structure. All paragraphs start with a dash, but the name isn't before the colon. So perhaps there's no consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by colon or similar.\\n\\nWait, but maybe the dash is considered similar to a colon? Like in some contexts, a dash is used for dialogue. But the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So the structure should be [Name][colon or similar][text]. For example, \\\"Знайка: Верно!\\\" or \\\"Знайка—Верно!\\\".\\n\\nBut in the current batch, the first paragraph starts with \\\"– Верно...\\\", which is a dash followed by space and then text. There's no name before the dash. So the dash is probably the dialogue marker, but the speaker's name isn't included in the paragraph. So maybe the actual speaker is indicated elsewhere, but in this paragraph, it's just the dialogue.\\n\\nSimilarly, the second paragraph is \\\"Все захлопали в ладоши. Кто-то крикнул:\\\" — this is a narrative sentence, ending with a colon, which might be followed by a quote. But the next paragraph starts with a dash, so maybe the quote is \\\"– Долой Звёздочкина!\\\".\\n\\nBut the task is about consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by colon or similar. So for example, if there's a paragraph starting with \\\"Знайка: ...\\\" and the next starts with \\\"Иван: ...\\\", then those would be consecutive with different names.\\n\\nBut in the current batch, the first paragraph starts with a dash, then text. The second paragraph is a narrative sentence ending with colon. Third starts with dash again. So none of them start with a name followed by colon or similar. The dash might be part of the dialogue, but the name isn't there. So perhaps there's no evidence here.\\n\\nWait, but maybe the dash is considered similar to a colon. But the structure would need to have the name before the dash. Like \\\"Знайка—Верно!\\\" but in the current items, the dash is at the start, so maybe it's a different format. For example, in some Russian texts, dialogue is marked with a dash, but the speaker's name is in a separate line or before the dash. But in the current batch, the paragraphs are:\\n\\n48: – Верно! ... (so the dash is the start, then the text)\\n\\n49: Все захлопали... Кто-то крикнул: (so this is a narrative sentence, ending with colon)\\n\\n50: – Долой Звёздочкина! (dash followed by text)\\n\\nSo maybe the second paragraph ends with a colon, which is part of the narrative, and the next paragraph starts with a dash. But the task is about paragraphs that start with a character's name followed by colon or similar. So the second paragraph starts with \\\"Все захлопали...\\\", which is not a name followed by colon. The third starts with a dash, not a name.\\n\\nSo perhaps there are no matches here. Let's check each item again.\\n\\nFor each item in the batch:\\n\\n- Pointer 48:1.1.1.p45: markdown starts with \\\"– Верно!...\\\", so the first character is a dash. No name before it. So not matching the pattern.\\n\\n- Pointer 49:1.1.1.p46: starts with \\\"Все захлопали...\\\", which is a narrative sentence. Ends with \\\"Кто-то крикнул:\\\", but the start is not a name followed by colon.\\n\\n- Pointer 50:1.1.1.p47: starts with \\\"– Долой...\\\", again dash followed by text. No name before the dash.\\n\\nSo none of the paragraphs start with a character's name followed by colon or similar. Therefore, there's no evidence to report.\\n\\nThe task says to check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by colon or similar, and names are different. But in this batch, there are no such paragraphs. So the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there's more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), but no new evidence found here.\\n\\nWait, the output needs to have \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue|done|not_found\\\". Since there's no evidence in this batch, and hasMoreBatches is true, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\". But the newEvidence list should be empty.\\n\\nWait, but the rules say: \\\"Do NOT add evidence for a pointer that appears in snapshot.recentEvidencePointers.\\\" But in this case, recentEvidencePointers is empty, but there's no evidence to add anyway.\\n\\nSo newEvidence should be an empty list. Decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches.\\n\\nWait, but the \\\"not_found\\\" decision is when there's no evidence and no more batches? Or maybe \\\"not_found\\\" is when the task can't be satisfied. But the rules say:\\n\\n- decision: \\\"continue|done|not_found\\\"\\n\\n- If maxEvidenceCount is provided and you have enough, set done.\\n\\nBut here maxEvidenceCount is null, so not applicable.\\n\\nIf there's no evidence in the current batch, and there are more batches, then decision is \\\"continue\\\".\\n\\nIf there's no evidence and no more batches, then \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\\nBut in this case, hasMoreBatches is true (from the input: {\\\"firstBatch\\\":false,\\\"hasMoreBatches\\\":true,...}), so decision should be \\\"continue\\\", and newEvidence is empty.\\n\\nYes. So the JSON should have decision \\\"continue\\\", newEvidence empty list.\\n\\nLet me check the rules again.\\n\\n\\\"Report ALL matches found in the batch. Do not try to filter for 'the second one' yourself. The agent needs all candidates to count correctly.\\\"\\n\\nBut in this case, there are no matches. So newEvidence is empty.\\n\\nSo the output should be:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\",\\n  \\\"newEvidence\\\": []\\n}\\n\\nYes. Because there's no evidence in this batch, but there are more batches to process. So continue.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":726,\"completion_tokens\":2073,\"total_tokens\":2799}}\n",
