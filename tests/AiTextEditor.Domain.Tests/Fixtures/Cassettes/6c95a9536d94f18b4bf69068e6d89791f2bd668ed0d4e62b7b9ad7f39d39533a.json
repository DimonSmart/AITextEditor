The goal is to find the first direct dialogue with two named characters in the same sentence. The context mentions examples like \\\"Alice says to Bob: Hello\\\" or \\\"John: Hi, Mary!\\\" So, I need to look for instances where two named characters are having a direct conversation in the same sentence.\\n\\nFirst, I'll check the provided batch items. The only item here is a paragraph with the pointer \\\"7:1.1.1.p4\\\". The markdown content is in Russian, so I need to make sure I'm not missing any dialogue. Let me read through the paragraph again.\\n\\nThe paragraph describes Pончик (Ponchik) dealing with moths in his home, the smell of naphthalene, and how others react to him. There's a lot of description about the smell and its effects, but I don't see any direct dialogue here. The sentences are all narrative, explaining the situation and the reactions of the characters. There's no instance where two characters are speaking directly to each other. \\n\\nSince the task requires direct dialogue between two named characters in the same sentence, and the provided text doesn't have any such instances, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\". The evidenceCount is 0, and since there's no new evidence to add, the newEvidence array remains empty. The decision is \\\"not_found\\\" because the required condition isn't met in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1002,\"completion_tokens\":309,\"total_tokens\":1311}}\n",
