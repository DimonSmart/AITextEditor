The user wants me to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the document. The task is to scan the current batch and extract evidence. First, I need to check each item in the batch's items array.\\n\\nLooking at the pointers provided, the first one is 76:1.1.1.p73. The markdown there talks about Zvezdочкиn being dragged out, but I don't see \\\"Фуксии\\\" here. Next, 77:1.1.1.p74 mentions the moon and a tribune, but again, no match. The same goes for 78:1.1.1.p75 and 79:1.1.1.p76. \\n\\nThen there's 80:1.1.1.p77 where Zvezdочкиn shouts about writing to the newspaper. Still no \\\"Фуксии\\\". The next paragraph, 81:1.1.1.p78, mentions closing the session. Not relevant. \\n\\nMoving to the next section, pointer 85:1.2.1.p1 talks about a newspaper report and mentions \\\"лунных коротышек\\\" (lunar gnomes), but not \\\"Фуксии\\\". The next paragraph, 86:1.2.1.p2, is truncated, so I can't check that. \\n\\nWait, the user's snapshot shows recent evidence pointers include 8:1.1.1.p5, 70:1.1.1.p67, 71:1.1.1.p68. But those aren't in the current batch. The current batch's items don't have any mention of \\\"Фуксии\\\". So, there's no new evidence here. \\n\\nSince the task is to find all mentions, but none are present in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the user's maxEvidenceCount is 100, but since there are no new matches, the decision remains \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1533,\"completion_tokens\":454,\"total_tokens\":1987}}\n",
