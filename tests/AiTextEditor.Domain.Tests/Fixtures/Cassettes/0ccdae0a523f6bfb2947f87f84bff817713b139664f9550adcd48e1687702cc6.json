The user wants the first dialogue between two named characters. I've tried several cursors with different filters, but none found anything. Maybe the dialogues aren't in lines but spread across paragraphs. Let me try a cursor that looks for paragraphs with two character names close to each other. Wait, I already tried that. Maybe the issue is that the dialogues are in separate paragraphs but part of the same conversation. I need to check if the cursor can handle that. Alternatively, maybe the names are mentioned in the same sentence without dialogue markers. Hmm, the user mentioned \\\"direct speech\\\" with dashes or quotes. If the text uses different markers, the cursors might miss it. Maybe the document uses ellipses or other symbols. I should adjust the filter to include various dialogue indicators. Let me create a new cursor with a broader filter for any dialogue markers and two names. If that doesn't work, perhaps the answer isn't in the text, so I should inform the user.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2347,\"completion_tokens\":232,\"total_tokens\":2579}}\n",
