The goal is to find the first direct dialogue with two named characters in the same sentence. The context mentions examples like \\\"Alice says to Bob: Hello\\\" or \\\"John: Hi, Mary!\\\" So I need to look for direct speech where two named characters are mentioned in the same sentence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, there's only one item with the pointer \\\"4:1.1.1.p1\\\". The markdown content is a paragraph in Russian. Let me read through it carefully. The paragraph talks about Незнайка (Nезнайка) and mentions Кнопочки and Пачкули Пёстренького. However, the text is descriptive and doesn't include any direct dialogue. There are no quotes or conversational exchanges between characters. The names are mentioned in the context of actions, like \\\"Наслушавшись рассказов Незнайки, Кнопочки и Пачкули Пёстренького\\\", but this is a narrative statement, not a dialogue. \\n\\nSince there's no direct dialogue between two named characters in the same sentence, the decision here would be \\\"not_found\\\". The newEvidence array remains empty because there are no qualifying excerpts. The evidenceCount is already 0 from the snapshot, and since the task's maxEvidenceCount is 1, but no evidence was found, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":993,\"completion_tokens\":302,\"total_tokens\":1295}}\n",
