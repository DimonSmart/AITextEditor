The user wants the first non-header mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". The context is all paragraphs containing that name, and the max evidence count is 1. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check the current batch's items. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence with pointer \\\"3:1.1.1\\\", but the user is asking for the first occurrence. However, the current batch's items don't have any mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". The pointers in the batch are 18:1.1.1.p15, 19:1.1.1.p16, and 20:1.3.1.p17. Looking at their markdown content, none of them include the professor's name. \\n\\nSince the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"3:1.1.1\\\", which isn't in the current batch, maybe that was from a previous batch. But the current batch doesn't have any matches. Therefore, there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required mention isn't present in the current batch's items.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":913,\"completion_tokens\":269,\"total_tokens\":1182}}\n",
