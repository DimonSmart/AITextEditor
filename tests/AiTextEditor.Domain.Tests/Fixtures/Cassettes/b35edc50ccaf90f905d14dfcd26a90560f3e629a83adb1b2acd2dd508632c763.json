The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdochkin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided the first batch of items. Let me look through the items.\\n\\nThe first item in the batch has a pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\" and the markdown content talks about Znayka visiting the Solar City and meeting scientists Fuxiya and Selyodka. It mentions their second flight to the Moon and their lunar expedition. However, there's no mention of Professor Zvezdochkin here. The text discusses the scientists they met but doesn't reference a professor by that name. \\n\\nSince the task is about finding the first occurrence, and this batch doesn't have it, I need to check if there are more batches. The context indicates that there are more batches (hasMore: true). Therefore, I should continue scanning the next batches. The current batch doesn't contain the required information, so the decision is to continue. No evidence is found here, so newEvidence is an empty array. The decision remains 'continue' because the answer isn't determined yet.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":770,\"completion_tokens\":247,\"total_tokens\":1017}}\n",
