The task is to find the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the given batch. The user provided a snapshot with evidenceCount 1 and recentEvidencePointers including \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". But the current batch items start from pointer \\\"45:1.1.1.p42\\\" onwards.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan each item in the current batch for the exact mention of \\\"Пончик\\\". The rules say to use only the current batch's content and not consider previous evidence pointers. The snapshot's recent pointers are from a previous batch, so I should ignore those.\\n\\nLooking at the first item's markdown: it talks about Знайка explaining something about the Moon's interior, but there's no mention of Пончик here. The second item is a response \\\"– Верно! – закричал кто-то.\\\" Still no Пончик. The third item has \\\"И сейчас же со всех сторон раздались крики:\\\" – also no match.\\n\\nNone of the current batch items contain \\\"Пончик\\\". Since the task is to find the first mention, and there's no occurrence in this batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the user's snapshot might have already found evidence in a previous batch, but the current batch doesn't contribute any new evidence. So the newEvidence array remains empty, and the decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":929,\"completion_tokens\":313,\"total_tokens\":1242}}\n",
