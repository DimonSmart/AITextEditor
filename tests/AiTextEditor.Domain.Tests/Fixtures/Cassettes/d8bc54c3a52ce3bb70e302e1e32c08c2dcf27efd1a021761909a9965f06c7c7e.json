The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. The context mentions paragraphs with named characters in dialogue format. The user provided a batch of items, and I need to scan them for evidence.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look through each item's markdown content. The first item (pointer 10:1.1.1.p7) is a paragraph discussing lunar craters and two theories. There's mention of \\\"Знайка\\\" and \\\"Стекляшкин,\\\" but they're not in a dialogue. The paragraph describes their observations but doesn't have a direct conversation between them.\\n\\nThe second item (pointer 11:1.1.1.p8) starts with \\\"Знайка, однако ж, не был согласен...\\\" which is a narrative, not a dialogue. Later, it mentions Знайка observing the Moon with Стекляшкин, but again, it's a description of their activity, not a dialogue. There's no direct exchange between them here either.\\n\\nSince there are no dialogues between named characters in the provided batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found.\\\" The newEvidence array remains empty because no valid dialogues were found. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and since there's no new evidence, the decision is \\\"not_found.\\\"\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1095,\"completion_tokens\":294,\"total_tokens\":1389}}\n",
