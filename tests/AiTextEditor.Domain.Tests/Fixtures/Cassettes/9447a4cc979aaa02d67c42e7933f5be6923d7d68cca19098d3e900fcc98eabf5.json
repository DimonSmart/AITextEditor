The user is looking for a place in the text where Znayka sarcastically comments on Professor Zvezdochkin's phrase about the center of the Moon. The task is to find such a mention.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, but the user is asking for another. The recentEvidencePointers include \\\"30:1.1.1.p27\\\", which I assume is from a previous batch, so I should ignore that.\\n\\nLooking at the current batch items, the pointers range from 58 to 73. Let me go through each paragraph:\\n\\n- Pointer 58: Describes Znayka's experience of weightlessness. No mention of the professor or the Moon's center.\\n- Pointer 59: Corrupts are excited, Znayka stops. Still no relevant info.\\n- Pointer 60: Znayka explains his movement in weightlessness. Still no mention of the professor's comment.\\n- Pointer 61: Discussion about the water in the bottle. Not relevant.\\n- Pointer 62-64: Questions about the drink and bringing something from the Moon. Still not relevant.\\n- Pointer 65: Someone asks if Znayka brought something from the Moon. Znayka shows a rock. The professor isn't mentioned here.\\n- Pointer 66: The professor isn't mentioned yet.\\n- Pointer 67: The rock is passed around, and Znayka's story is well-received. The professor isn't mentioned here either.\\n- Pointer 68: Wait, here's the key part. After Znayka's story, the professor gets up and says something. The user's task is about the professor's phrase regarding the Moon's center. Let me check the exact text.\\n\\nLooking at pointer 70: \\\"Только профессор Звёздочкин был не очень доволен. Как только Знайка кончил свой рассказ и сошёл с трибуны, профессор Звёздочкин выскочил на трибуну и сказал:\\\" \\n\\nThis is where the professor reacts. The next paragraph (pointer 71) starts with the professor's speech. The user is looking for a sarcastic comment from Znayka about the professor's phrase regarding the Moon's center. However, in the provided text, the professor is the one speaking, not Znayka. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The task says Znayka is making a sarcastic remark about the professor's phrase. But in the given text, after Znayka's story, the professor is the one who gets up and starts speaking. The professor's lines in pointer 71 start with \\\"Дорогие друзья...\\\" which is a formal speech. There's no mention of the Moon's center here. \\n\\nLooking further, pointer 73 has the professor saying \\\"Однако… – повторил, повышая голос, профессор Звёздочкин. – Однако мы собрались здесь вовсе не для того, чтоб про Луну слушать, а для того, чтоб обсудить Знайкину книжку...\\\" This is the professor talking about the purpose of the gathering, not about the Moon's center. \\n\\nWait, maybe the professor's comment about the Moon's center is in another part. Let me check all the paragraphs again. The user's task is about a specific phrase from the professor regarding the Moon's center. However, in the provided batch items, I don't see any mention of the professor discussing the Moon's center. The only mention of the professor is his reaction to Znayka's story, but not about the center of the Moon. \\n\\nTherefore, there might be no new evidence in the current batch. The user's task might not have any matches in the current batch, so the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2219,\"completion_tokens\":865,\"total_tokens\":3084}}\n",
