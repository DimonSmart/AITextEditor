The user wants me to find all mentions of 'профессора Звёздочкина' in the current batch, excluding headers. The task says to look for content that includes this name and isn't a header. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so I need to check the current batch items.\\n\\nLooking at the items provided: there are three paragraphs. The first one talks about lunar craters and meteorites, the second discusses Znayka's response about meteorite impacts, and the third mentions vulcanologists and meteoritists dismissing Znayka. Wait, none of these paragraphs mention 'профессора Звёздочкина' at all. The name isn't present in any of the markdown content. The user might have expected it, but according to the given data, there's no match. So the decision should be 'not_found' since there's no evidence in the current batch. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't need to set 'done' here. The newEvidence array will be empty. Let me double-check each paragraph again to make sure I didn't miss any mention. Nope, the name isn't there. So the correct output is 'not_found' with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":910,\"completion_tokens\":286,\"total_tokens\":1196}}\n",
