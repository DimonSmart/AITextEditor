The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. The context is all paragraphs, so I need to check every paragraph in the current batch.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (pointer 8:1.1.1.p5), the characters mentioned are Знайка, Фуксией, and Селёдочкой. The text talks about Знайка working with these two on building a rocket and their moon trip. However, there's no direct dialogue here, just narrative.\\n\\nThe second paragraph (pointer 9:1.1.1.p6) mentions Знайка and Стекляшкин. The text says Знайка told stories about his trip, which interested Стекляшкин. But again, no dialogue is present here either. The conversation is implied through actions, not actual spoken words between two named characters.\\n\\nSince the task requires a dialogue (spoken exchange) between two named characters, and neither paragraph contains such a dialogue, there's no evidence to report. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the current batch doesn't have the required information. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and since there are no new matches, the decision remains not_found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1300,\"completion_tokens\":278,\"total_tokens\":1578}}\n",
