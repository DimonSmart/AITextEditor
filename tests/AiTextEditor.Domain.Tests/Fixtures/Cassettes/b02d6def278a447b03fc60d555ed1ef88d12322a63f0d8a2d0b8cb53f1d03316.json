But wait, the task is about Professor Zvezdokin, not Znayka. The text here talks about Znayka, not Zvezdokin. So this isn't a match. \\n\\nSince the batch doesn't have any mention of Professor Zvezdokin, and there are more batches to come (hasMore is true), the decision should be \\\"continue\\\". The evidence array is empty because no matching text was found. So the JSON should reflect that no evidence was found in this batch, and we need to keep scanning.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":526,\"completion_tokens\":219,\"total_tokens\":745}}\n",
