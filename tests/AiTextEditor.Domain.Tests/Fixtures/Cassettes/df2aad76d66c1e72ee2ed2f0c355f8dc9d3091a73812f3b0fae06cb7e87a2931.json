The user is asking where in the book it's described how the astronomers in the Sun City got into a fight and split into the volcanologists and meteoritologists. \\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the steps taken so far. The assistant created a keyword cursor with the keywords related to astronomers, Sun City, splitting, volcanologists, and meteoritologists. Then, they read batches from the cursor. \\n\\nLooking at the responses, the first batch didn't have the relevant info. The second batch mentioned the Sun City and some construction, but not the conflict. The third batch talked about Znayka's trip to the Moon and the lunar craters. Then, in the fourth batch, there's a paragraph that mentions the astronomers in Sun City arguing about the origin of lunar craters, splitting into two groups: volcanologists and meteoritologists. That's exactly what the user is asking for.\\n\\nSo, the answer should point to that specific paragraph. The SemanticPointer for that paragraph is 10:1.1.1.p7. The stop reason is goal_reached because the information was found. The final answer needs to mention the goal and the stop reason, and include the semantic pointer.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_c5l6j2qa\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":4130,\"completion_tokens\":279,\"total_tokens\":4409}}\n",
