The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context specifies that all paragraphs with direct speech markers and at least two named characters should be considered. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, the first item (12:1.1.1.p9) is a paragraph about the Moon's surface, mentioning Знайка but no dialogue. The second item (13:1.1.1.p10) states that astronomers laughed at Знайка's theory, but again, no direct speech. The third item (14:1.1.1.p11) starts with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\", which is a direct speech marker. However, it's just the beginning of a sentence, so maybe the actual dialogue starts in the next paragraph. But since the batch only includes up to p11, and there's no further content, perhaps this is the only possible candidate. However, the paragraph doesn't have a second named character in the dialogue. The mention of \\\"вулканисты\\\" (volcanologists) is a group, not a named character. So maybe there's no valid dialogue here. The task requires two named characters, so this might not qualify. Therefore, the answer is \\\"not_found\\\" since there's no valid dialogue meeting the criteria.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1082,\"completion_tokens\":311,\"total_tokens\":1393}}\n",
