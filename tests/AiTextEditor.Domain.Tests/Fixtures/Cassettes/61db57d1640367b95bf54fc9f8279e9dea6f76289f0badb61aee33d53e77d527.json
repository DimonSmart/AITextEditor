The user is looking for a description of two rotating buildings on Kolokolchikov Street with a spiral descent and a devil's wheel on the roof. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, pointer 4:1.1.1.p1, but I need to check the current batch items.\\n\\nLooking at the batch items, all the pointers are from 12:1.1.1.p9 to 22:1.1.1.p19. The task is in Russian, so I need to make sure I'm not missing any mentions of rotating buildings, spiral stairs, or a devil's wheel. \\n\\nThe first item (12:1.1.1.p9) talks about the Moon's surface and bubbles, which doesn't seem relevant. The rest of the paragraphs discuss astronomers' theories about lunar craters, Znayka's theories about the Moon being made of dough, and later his visit to the Moon where he finds brick walls and mentions lunar inhabitants. There's a mention of \\\"кирпичной стены\\\" (brick wall) and \\\"стеклянные купола\\\" (glass domes), but nothing about rotating buildings, spiral descents, or a devil's wheel. \\n\\nNone of the excerpts mention the specific elements required for the task. The existing evidence pointer 4:1.1.1.p1 isn't in the current batch, so maybe it's from a previous batch. Since the current batch doesn't have any relevant content, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2005,\"completion_tokens\":344,\"total_tokens\":2349}}\n",
