The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided the first batch of items. Looking at the items, there's only one paragraph with pointer \\\"12:1.1.1.p9\\\". The markdown content talks about the Moon's surface, lava, bubbles, and rings, but there's no mention of a professor or Zvezdokin. The evidenceCount is 0, and since there are more batches to come (hasMore is true), I shouldn't decide 'done' yet. The correct decision here is 'continue' because the first occurrence might be in a subsequent batch. No evidence found in the current batch, so newEvidence is empty. The decision remains 'continue' to keep scanning.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":823,\"completion_tokens\":179,\"total_tokens\":1002}}\n",
