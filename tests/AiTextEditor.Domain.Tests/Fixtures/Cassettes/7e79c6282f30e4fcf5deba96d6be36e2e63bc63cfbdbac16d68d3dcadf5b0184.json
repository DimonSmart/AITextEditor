The goal is to find the first direct dialogue with two named characters in the same sentence. The context mentions examples like 'Alice says to Bob: Hello' or 'John: Hi, Mary!'. So I need to look for instances where two named characters are having a direct conversation in the same sentence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, there's only one paragraph with the pointer \\\"5:1.1.1.p2\\\". The markdown content is in Russian, so I need to check if there's any direct dialogue here. Let me read through the text again.\\n\\nThe paragraph talks about the inhabitants of the Sunny City helping the short residents of the Flower City with construction. It mentions Engineer Klyepka's project for a large clothing factory. There's a lot of detail about the factory and its operations, but I don't see any direct dialogue. The sentences are all narrative, describing actions and events without any characters speaking directly. \\n\\nSince the task requires direct dialogue between two named characters in the same sentence, and the provided text doesn't have any such instances, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". There's no evidence here that meets the criteria. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and since there are no new matches in this batch, the newEvidence array remains empty. Therefore, the output should indicate that no evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":916,\"completion_tokens\":296,\"total_tokens\":1212}}\n",
