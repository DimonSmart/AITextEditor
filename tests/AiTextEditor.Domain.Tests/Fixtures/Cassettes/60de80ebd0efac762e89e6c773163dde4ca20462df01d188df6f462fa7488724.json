The user wants the first mention of Fuchs in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to find any reference to Fuchs. \\n\\nLooking at the first item, the markdown is in Russian, talking about lunar craters and meteorites. No mention of Fuchs here. The second item continues the discussion about meteorites and craters, still no Fuchs. The third item mentions \\\"вулканисты и метеоритчики\\\" which translates to volcanologists and meteoritologists, but again, no Fuchs.\\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"first mention of Fuchs,\\\" but none of the excerpts in the current batch items mention Fuchs. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5,\\\" which might be from a previous batch, but the current batch doesn't have any references to Fuchs. So, according to the rules, if there's no evidence in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found.\\\" Also, the user specified to use only the current batch's content. Since there's no mention of Fuchs here, the correct response is to indicate that no new evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":894,\"completion_tokens\":267,\"total_tokens\":1161}}\n",
