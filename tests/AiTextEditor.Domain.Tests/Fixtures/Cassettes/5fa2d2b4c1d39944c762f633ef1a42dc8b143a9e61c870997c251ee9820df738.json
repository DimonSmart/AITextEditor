The user wants me to find all mentions of 'профессора Звёздочкина' in the current batch, excluding headers. The task says to scan only the current batch's items and extract relevant evidence.\\n\\nFirst, I'll check each item's markdown content. The first item's markdown is about lunar craters and volcanoes, no mention of the professor. The second paragraph also discusses volcanoes and lunar features, still no match. The third item's markdown is \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\", which translates to \\\"Meteorite experts said,\\\" but again, no reference to профессора Звёздочкина.\\n\\nSince none of the provided paragraphs mention the professor, the newEvidence array should be empty. The decision would be \\\"continue\\\" because there's no evidence found. Also, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and since there are no new evidences, the total remains 0. The user might have more batches coming, so we keep scanning. No need to set decision to \\\"done\\\" or \\\"not_found\\\" here. Just continue processing.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":805,\"completion_tokens\":243,\"total_tokens\":1048}}\n",
