The user wants the first mention of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" excluding headers. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so we need to look through the current batch.\\n\\nLooking at the items in the batch, all the pointers are paragraphs. The first item is 8:1.1.1.p5. Let me check the markdown there. The text mentions Знайка and his travels, but no Звёздочкина. Next is 9:1.1.1.p6, which talks about Знайка's return and Стекляшкин, but still no Звёздочкина. The third item, 10:1.1.1.p7, discusses debates among astronomers about the origin of lunar craters. Still no mention. The fourth item, 11:1.1.1.p8, continues the discussion about Знайка's theory but again no Звёздочкина.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me scan each paragraph again. The first paragraph mentions Знайка, but not Звёздочкина. The second talks about Стекляшкин. The third mentions астрономы in the Solar city arguing. The fourth still no. Hmm, none of the paragraphs mention профессора Звёздочкина. So the answer would be not_found. But wait, the task says to exclude headers, but maybe there's a heading I missed? The user said to ignore headings unless the task asks for them. Since the task doesn't mention headers, I should focus only on the content. Since none of the paragraphs in the current batch mention Звёздочкина, the decision is not_found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1696,\"completion_tokens\":390,\"total_tokens\":2086}}\n",
