The user wants the first mention of 'визуализация лунного кратера' described as 'огромного круглого поля с земляным валом по краю'. First, I need to scan through the provided batch items to find any occurrence of the exact phrase 'визуализация лунного кратера'. \\n\\nLooking at the items, the first paragraph (24:1.1.1.p21) talks about a book by Znayka but doesn't mention the specific term. The next paragraphs discuss a professor's critique of the book, but again, no mention of the required terms. \\n\\nContinuing through the items, paragraph 28:1.1.1.p25 mentions the professor's lecture, but still no match. Paragraph 34:1.1.1.p31 has a discussion about a bottle in space, which is related to gravity but not the exact terms. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each paragraph again. The term 'визуализация лунного кратера' isn't present in any of the provided items. The closest is paragraph 36:1.1.1.p33 where Znayka compares the bottle to a planet, but that's not the exact description needed. \\n\\nSince none of the items in the current batch contain the exact phrase or the required description, the decision should be 'not_found'. The user's task requires specific terms that aren't present here. Also, the snapshot shows no previous evidence, so even if there was a match, it's not in this batch. Therefore, the correct output is 'not_found' with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2455,\"completion_tokens\":374,\"total_tokens\":2829}}\n",
