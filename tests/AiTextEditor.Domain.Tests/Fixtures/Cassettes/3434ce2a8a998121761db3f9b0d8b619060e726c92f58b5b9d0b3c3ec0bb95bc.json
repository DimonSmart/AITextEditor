The user is asking in which paragraph Ponchik, after choosing a darker night, drowned his old costumes in the Ogurcovka River. First, I need to find the relevant section in the document.\\n\\nThe user mentioned using the cursor-create_keyword_cursor tool with keywords like \\\"пончик,\\\" \\\"ночка,\\\" \\\"утопить,\\\" \\\"костюм,\\\" and \\\"река.\\\" The response from the tool is \\\"keyword_cursor_0,\\\" which I assume is the cursor name. Now, I need to read batches from this cursor to find the matching paragraph.\\n\\nI'll start by calling cursor-read_cursor_batch with the cursor name \\\"keyword_cursor_0.\\\" This should return the first batch of items that contain any of the keywords. Once I get the batch, I'll check each item's text to see if it matches the scenario described. \\n\\nLooking for the exact phrase \\\"Пончик, выбрав потемней ночку, утопил старые костюмы в Огурцовой реке\\\" in the paragraph. Since the keywords might be spread across different parts of the text, I need to scan through each paragraph carefully. Once found, I'll note the pointer of that paragraph and finalize the answer. If not found in the first batch, I'll continue reading subsequent batches until the cursor runs out or the answer is found. If the answer isn't in the initial batches, I might need to adjust the keywords or check if the cursor was created correctly. But given the keywords, it's likely in the first batch. Let's proceed.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_2grthi25\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"keyword_cursor_0\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1240,\"completion_tokens\":358,\"total_tokens\":1598}}\n",
