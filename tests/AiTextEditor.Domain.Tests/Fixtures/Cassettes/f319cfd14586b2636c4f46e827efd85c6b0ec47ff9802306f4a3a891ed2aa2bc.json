The current batch is the first one, and there's more to come.\\n\\nLooking at the provided item, the pointer is \\\"21:1.1.1.p18\\\" and the markdown text talks about Znayka (which might be a nickname) rejecting his theory after visiting the Moon and seeing a crater. It mentions a brick wall made of bricks, but there's no mention of Professor Zvezdochkin here. The text discusses lunar craters and bricks, but the professor's name isn't in this paragraph. \\n\\nSince the task is to find the first occurrence, and this batch doesn't have it, I need to check if there are any other items in this batch. But the items array only has this one paragraph. So, no match here. The decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches to process. The newEvidence array will be empty since no matches were found. I should output the JSON with decision \\\"continue\\\" and empty newEvidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":622,\"completion_tokens\":244,\"total_tokens\":866}}\n",
