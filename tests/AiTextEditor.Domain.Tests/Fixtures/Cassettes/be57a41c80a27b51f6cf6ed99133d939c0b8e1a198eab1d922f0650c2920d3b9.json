The goal is to find the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The context is paragraphs with dialogue markers mentioning Znayka and Professor. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so we need to find new evidence. The items are paragraphs 24, 25, and 26. \\n\\nLooking at paragraph 25: The professor is giving a lecture, criticizing Znayka's book. He mentions that Znayka made a mistake by thinking certain things were bricks when they were actually a type of rock. Then the professor talks about the Moon's center, saying that if there were no bricks, there could be no little lunar creatures (corotushki-lunatiki) because they couldn't live on the inner surface due to gravity pulling everything to the center. But this is the professor's opinion, not Znayka's.\\n\\nNow, paragraph 26 starts with Znayka standing up and speaking mockingly. The markdown here is \\\"Выслушав всё это, Знайка поднялся со своего места и сказал насмешливо:\\\" which translates to \\\"After hearing all this, Znayka stood up from his seat and said mockingly:\\\". This is the first mention of Znayka responding sarcastically. However, the actual comment about the professor being stuck in the Moon's center isn't here yet. The next paragraph might have it, but since the user only provided up to paragraph 26, maybe this is the first instance where Znayka is sarcastically commenting. Wait, the task says \\\"the first mention of Znay's sarcastic comment on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center.\\\" The professor's part about the Moon's center is in paragraph 25, but Znayka's response is in paragraph 26. However, the excerpt in 26 is just the setup for his comment, not the actual comment. The actual comment might be in the next paragraph, which isn't provided here. Since the user's input only includes up to paragraph 26, maybe the first mention is in 26, but the actual content of the comment isn't present. Wait, the task says \\\"the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting,\\\" so the act of him speaking mockingly is the first mention. The actual content of his comment might be in the next paragraph, but since it's not included here, perhaps the first mention is the setup in paragraph 26. Alternatively, maybe there's no actual comment in the provided text, so the answer is that there's no evidence. But according to the rules, we have to report all matches found in the current batch. Since the first mention of Znayka's sarcastic comment is in paragraph 26, even if the full comment isn't here, that's the first instance. So the newEvidence would be the pointer 29:1.1.1.p26 with the excerpt as given, and the reason being that Znayka is speaking mockingly after the professor's lecture. However, the task specifically mentions the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The professor's comment about the Moon's center is in paragraph 25, but Znayka's sarcastic comment on that would be in the next paragraph. Since the current batch only includes up to paragraph 26, maybe the first mention is in 26, but the actual content isn't here. Therefore, the answer is that there's no evidence in the current batch, so decision is \\\"not_found\\\". Wait, but the user's input includes up to paragraph 26, which is the start of Znayka's sarcastic comment. The actual comment might be in the next paragraph, which isn't provided. So based on the current batch, there's no full evidence. Hence, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1059,\"completion_tokens\":854,\"total_tokens\":1913}}\n",
