The two paragraphs given: first paragraph about Ponchik costumes, no \\\"Фуксии\\\". Second paragraph about moth, no \\\"Фуксии\\\". No match. So no new evidence. Decision? Since no evidence found, but there are more batches. The snapshot evidenceCount =0. We haven't found any match. According to schema: decisions: continue|done|not_found. If no evidence found in this batch and there are more batches, likely continue. But also if we've scanned all and none found, not_found.
