The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. The context is all paragraphs, and we need to scan the current batch.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look through each item in the batch. The first item has a pointer 4:1.1.1.p1. The markdown here talks about Незнайка, Кнопочки, and Пачкули Пёстренького. But I don't see any dialogue here—just narrative. The second item is pointer 5:1.1.1.p2, which mentions инженера Клёпки and talks about a factory. Again, no dialogue between named characters.\\n\\nSince there's no dialogue in either paragraph, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The newEvidence array remains empty. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and since there's no new evidence, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1253,\"completion_tokens\":208,\"total_tokens\":1461}}\n",
