The user is asking about a specific instance in a book where Znayka (probably a character name) sarcastically comments on Professor's phrase about having to hang around the center of the Moon. The user wants to know the exact location in the text where this happens.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out which book this is. Since the user mentioned \\\"Знайка\\\" (Znayka), which is a character from the Soviet children's book series \\\"Znayka and the Professor\\\" by Kirill Fedorov. The story involves a professor and Znayka, who are often in humorous situations. The phrase in question is likely from one of the stories where the professor makes a boastful claim, and Znayka mocks him.\\n\\nThe user wants the location, so I need to find the specific paragraph or section where this occurs. Since the book is loaded into the kernel functions, I should use the CursorAgentPlugin-run_cursor_agent function to search for the relevant text. The task is to find the first occurrence where Znayka uses a sarcastic remark about the professor having to hang around the Moon's center.\\n\\nI'll start by setting up the function call. The taskDescription should be something like \\\"Find the location where Znayka sarcastically comments on the professor's claim about hanging around the center of the Moon.\\\" The startAfterPointer might not be needed initially, but if the first search doesn't find it, I might need to adjust. However, since the user is asking for the first mention, I'll start from the beginning.\\n\\nI need to make sure that the function is called correctly, using the taskDescription as specified. The context parameter isn't needed here since it's the first run. The function will then search through the document and return the relevant paragraph. Once found, I'll note the pointerLabel and include it in the answer. If the function doesn't find it, I'll have to inform the user that it's not present in the document. But given the context, it's likely present, so the answer should include the pointer and the paragraph.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_1o0d355b\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"CursorAgentPlugin-run_cursor_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"context\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"startAfterPointer\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Найти место в тексте, где Знайка язвительно поддевает профессора фразой про центр Луны\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":380,\"completion_tokens\":509,\"total_tokens\":889}}\n",
