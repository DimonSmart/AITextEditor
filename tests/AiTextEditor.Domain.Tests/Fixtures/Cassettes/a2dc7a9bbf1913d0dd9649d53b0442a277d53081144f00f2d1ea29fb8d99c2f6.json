The user's task is to find the second mention of Professor Zvezdokhin, excluding headers. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and there are no recent evidence pointers. The current batch has several items, including paragraphs.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the batch items to find any mentions of Professor Zvezdokhin. The user mentioned to exclude headers, so I'll focus on Paragraph and ListItem items. \\n\\nLooking at the pointers, the first paragraph (4:1.1.1.p1) talks about Znayka's journey and mentions Professor Zvezdokhin in the heading. But since headers are excluded, I can't count that. The next paragraphs (4:1.1.1.p2 to p4) discuss the changes in the city and Ponchik's troubles. I don't see any mention of the professor here. \\n\\nWait, the third paragraph (6:1.1.1.p3) mentions Ponchik's old costumes, but no professor. The fourth paragraph (7:1.1.1.p4) talks about the moth problem. Still no mention of the professor. \\n\\nHmm, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first heading (3:1.1.1) is a heading, so excluded. The paragraphs after that don't mention the professor. The user's task is to find the second occurrence, but in the current batch, there's only the first mention in the heading. Since the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, maybe the first mention isn't counted here. Wait, the user said to exclude headers, so the first mention in the heading isn't considered. Therefore, in the current batch, there's no valid mention of the professor. \\n\\nSince the task requires the second mention and the current batch doesn't have any, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there might be more batches. But according to the rules, if the task depends on counts and the target is 2 (since \\\"второе\\\" means second), and the previous count is 0, we need to find at least 2. But in this batch, there's none. So the newEvidence array is empty, and the decision remains \\\"continue\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2312,\"completion_tokens\":484,\"total_tokens\":2796}}\n",
