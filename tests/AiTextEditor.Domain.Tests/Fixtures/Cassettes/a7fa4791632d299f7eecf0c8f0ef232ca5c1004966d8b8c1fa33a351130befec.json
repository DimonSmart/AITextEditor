The user wants to find the first mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through the current batch's items to see where this mention occurs.\\n\\nLooking at the snapshot, the evidenceCount is 0, and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so there's no prior evidence to consider. The task is to find the first occurrence, so I need to check each item in the batch sequentially.\\n\\nStarting with the first item, it's a heading: \\\"# Часть I\\\". No mention there. Next is \\\"## Глава первая\\\" – still no. Then \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". Wait, here's the name! But the user is looking for the first mention. However, this is a heading, not a paragraph. The instructions say to prefer Paragraph or ListItem content. The next items are paragraphs. Let me check if there's an earlier mention in the paragraphs. \\n\\nLooking at the paragraphs, the first paragraph (4:1.1.1.p1) talks about Незнайка's journey but doesn't mention Звёздочкин. The second paragraph (5:1.1.1.p2) mentions the professor in the context of the story. Wait, no, the heading mentions \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" as part of the title. But the user's task is to find the first mention. Since the heading is part of the document, even though it's a heading, it's the first occurrence. However, the rules say to prefer Paragraph/ListItem content. But the heading is the first instance. Wait, the user's task says \\\"first mention,\\\" so even if it's a heading, it's the first occurrence. But the evidence rules state to use only current batch content. The heading is part of the batch. So the first mention is in the heading \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". But the user might be looking for a paragraph. However, the task says \\\"first mention,\\\" so regardless of the item type, the earliest occurrence is the heading. But the user's context is about mentions of the professor, so the heading is the first mention. However, the user might have intended the actual paragraph where the professor is discussed. Wait, the heading is part of the document's structure. The actual mention in the text might be in the paragraphs. Let me check again. The heading is \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\" which includes the professor's name. So that's the first mention. But the user's task is to find the first mention, so even if it's a heading, it's valid. However, the instructions say to prefer Paragraph/ListItem content. But the heading is the first occurrence. So the correct pointer is 3:1.1.1. The excerpt is the heading's markdown. The reason is that the heading mentions the professor's name. So the newEvidence should include that pointer. But wait, the user's task is to find the first mention, so even if it's a heading, it's the first occurrence. Therefore, the answer should include that heading as the first mention.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1888,\"completion_tokens\":752,\"total_tokens\":2640}}\n",
