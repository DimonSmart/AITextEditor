The task is to find mentions of \\\"профессора Звёздочкин\\\". The current batch has three items. Let me check each one.\\n\\nFirst item: pointer \\\"1:1\\\", Heading, markdown \\\"# Часть I\\\". No mention of the professor here. Just a part title.\\n\\nSecond item: \\\"2:1.1\\\", Heading, \\\"## Глава первая\\\". Again, just a chapter heading. No mention of the professor.\\n\\nThird item: \\\"3:1.1.1\\\", Heading, \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". Here, the markdown says \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". So the exact phrase \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" is there. Wait, the task says \\\"найти упоминание профессора Звёздочкин\\\". The actual text has \\\"Звёздочкина\\\", which is the genitive case. But the task's target is \\\"профессора Звёздочкин\\\" – but maybe the name is \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" and in the text it's \\\"Звёздочкина\\\" as part of the phrase. So the mention is there. The exact string in the markdown includes \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\", which matches the task's requirement since the task is to find mentions of \\\"профессора Звёздочкин\\\" – but maybe the case or the ending is different. Wait, the task says \\\"профессора Звёздочкин\\\" but in the text it's \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\". Hmm, but in Russian, \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" would be the nominative, and \\\"Звёздочкина\\\" is genitive. So the actual mention in the text is \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\", which is a correct grammatical form. The task's goal is to find mentions of \\\"профессора Звёздочкин\\\" – but maybe the task is written in a way that the name is \\\"Звёздочкин\\\", and the text uses the genitive case. So the mention is there. So this item should be considered as evidence.\\n\\nNow, check the snapshot: evidenceCount is 0, recentEvidencePointers is empty. So no previous evidence. So this third item is a new candidate.\\n\\nThe decision: since maxEvidenceCount is null, we don't have a limit. But we need to check if we should continue or done. Since there's at least one match, but the task might need more, but since max is null, we can just report the found evidence. However, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" if there are more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), but the current batch has the evidence. Wait, the decision is based on whether we have enough evidence. Since maxEvidenceCount is null, there's no max, so we don't set decision to done. So decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), but we found some evidence. Wait, the decision options are \\\"continue\\\", \\\"done\\\", or \\\"not_found\\\". \\n\\nWait, the rules say: if maxEvidenceCount is provided and snapshot.evidenceCount + newEvidence.length \\u003e= max, then decision=\\\"done\\\". But here maxEvidenceCount is null, so that condition doesn't apply. So even if we found evidence, since there's more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), we should set decision to \\\"continue\\\". Because the system needs to process more batches. But the current batch has the evidence, so we need to output the newEvidence.\\n\\nSo for the third item, pointer \\\"3:1.1.1\\\", excerpt is \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". The reason should be a sentence explaining that the excerpt contains \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\", which matches the task's target. But the task says \\\"найти упоминание профессора Звёздочкин\\\" – but the actual text has \\\"Звёздочкина\\\". However, the task's goal is to find mentions of that name, regardless of case or grammatical form. So the reason should state that the excerpt contains the exact phrase \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\", which includes the name.\\n\\nBut the rule says: reason must be local and factual, 1 sentence max. So \\\"Contains 'профессора Звёздочкина' as part of the heading.\\\"\\n\\nWait, the task's goal is \\\"найти упоминание профессора Звёздочкин\\\" – but the actual text has \\\"Звёздочкина\\\", which is the genitive case. But the name is \\\"Звёздочкин\\\", so the mention is there. So the reason should say that the excerpt includes the name \\\"Звёздочкина\\\" which is part of the task's target.\\n\\nBut the task says \\\"профессора Звёздочкин\\\" – but in Russian, when you say \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\", it's correct. So the mention is there. So the reason is \\\"Excerpt contains 'профессора Звёздочкина'\\\".\\n\\nBut the rule says: MUST be local and factual: explain what in the excerpt matches the task. So the exact string in the excerpt is \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\", so the part \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" is present. So the reason is \\\"Contains 'профессора Звёздочкина'\\\".\\n\\nNow, check if the pointer is already in recentEvidencePointers. The snapshot says recentEvidencePointers is empty, so this pointer \\\"3:1.1.1\\\" is new.\\n\\nSo newEvidence should have one item: pointer \\\"3:1.1.1\\\", excerpt exactly as in markdown, reason as above.\\n\\nDecision: since hasMoreBatches is true, and maxEvidenceCount is null, we don't have a max, so even if we found some evidence, we need to continue processing more batches. So decision is \\\"continue\\\".\\n\\nWait, but the decision is based on whether we have enough evidence. Since max is null, there's no max, so we don't set to done. So decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches. If there were no more batches, then maybe \\\"done\\\" after processing all. But here hasMoreBatches is true, so decision is \\\"continue\\\".\\n\\nSo the output JSON should have decision \\\"continue\\\", newEvidence with the one item.\\n\\nCheck if any other items in the batch have the mention. The first two are headings without the name. Only the third one. So yes.\\n\\nSo the JSON would be:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\",\\n  \\\"newEvidence\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"pointer\\\": \\\"3:1.1.1\\\",\\n      \\\"excerpt\\\": \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\",\\n      \\\"reason\\\": \\\"Contains 'профессора Звёздочкина'\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nWait, but the reason must be exactly what's in the excerpt. The task is to find \\\"профессора Звёздочкин\\\", but the excerpt has \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\". So the reason should state that the excerpt contains the exact string \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\", which matches the task's requirement. Because the task's goal is to find mentions of that name, even if it's in a different case or grammatical form. So the reason is correct.\\n\\nYes. So this should be the output.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":668,\"completion_tokens\":1718,\"total_tokens\":2386}}\n",
