The user wants to find the first non-header mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". Wait, but looking at the provided batch items, none of the paragraphs mention \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"3:1.1.1\\\", which might be from a previous batch, but the current batch's items don't have that pointer. The items here are 21:1.1.1.p18, 22:1.1.1.p19, 23:1.1.1.p20. All the markdown content in these items talks about Знайка and the lunar inhabitants, but there's no mention of профессор Звёздочкин. So, based on the current batch, there's no evidence that matches the task. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the required mention isn't present here. Also, the user specified to use only the current batch, so even if previous batches had evidence, we can't consider them here. Therefore, the output should indicate that no new evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1305,\"completion_tokens\":259,\"total_tokens\":1564}}\n",
