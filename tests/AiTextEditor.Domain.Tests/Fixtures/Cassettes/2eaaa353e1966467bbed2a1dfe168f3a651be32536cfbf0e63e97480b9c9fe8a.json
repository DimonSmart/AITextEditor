The task is to find the first mention of Fuchs in the provided text. First, I need to scan through the current batch items to see if any of them mention Fuchs. The user mentioned that the snapshot has evidenceCount 1 and recentEvidencePointers including \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but since the firstBatch is false and hasMoreBatches is true, I should focus on the current batch.\\n\\nLooking at the items in the batch, all the pointers start from 12:1.1.1.p9 up to 22:1.1.1.p19. The markdown content in these paragraphs talks about Znayka's theories about the Moon's surface, volcanic activity, meteorite impacts, and later the lunar inhabitants called \\\"lunatiki.\\\" I need to check each paragraph for the name Fuchs. \\n\\nGoing through each entry:\\n\\n1. 12:1.1.1.p9: Discusses the Moon's surface being molten and cooling. No mention of Fuchs.\\n2. 13:1.1.1.p10: Astronomers laughing at Znayka's theory. Still no Fuchs.\\n3. 14:1.1.1.p11: Volcanologists' response. No.\\n4. 15:1.1.1.p12: Volcanologists question the need for Znayka's theory. No.\\n5. 16:1.1.1.p13: Znayka's reply about volcanoes. No.\\n6. 17:1.1.1.p14: Meteoritologists' argument. No.\\n7. 18:1.1.1.p15: Meteoritologists say craters aren't from meteorites. No.\\n8. 19:1.1.1.p16: Znayka's counter about meteorite angles. No.\\n9. 20:1.1.1.p17: Volcanologists and meteoritologists dismiss Znayka. No.\\n10. 21:1.1.1.p18: Znayka visits the Moon and sees a crater. No Fuchs here.\\n11. 22:1.1.1.p19: Znayka concludes about lunar inhabitants, \\\"lunatiki.\\\" Still no Fuchs.\\n\\nWait, none of the paragraphs mention Fuchs. The task is to find the first mention, but in the current batch, there's no reference to Fuchs. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", which might be from a previous batch. Since the current batch doesn't have any mentions, the decision should be \\\"not_found.\\\" The user's instruction says to use only the current batch, so even if there's a mention in a previous batch, it's not considered here. Therefore, the output should indicate that no new evidence is found in this batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1979,\"completion_tokens\":654,\"total_tokens\":2633}}\n",
