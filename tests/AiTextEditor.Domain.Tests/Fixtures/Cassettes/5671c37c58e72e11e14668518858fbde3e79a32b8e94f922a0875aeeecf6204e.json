The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. The context is all paragraphs, and the maxEvidenceCount is null, so we need to find all such dialogues but stop if we reach the first one.\\n\\nFirst, I'll scan through the provided batch items. The first item is a paragraph discussing lunar craters and two theories, mentioning astronomers divided into two groups. The second paragraph talks about Znayka and Steklyashkin observing the Moon through a telescope. \\n\\nLooking for dialogues, the second paragraph mentions them observing the Moon and Znayka's theory. However, there's no direct dialogue here. The first paragraph mentions \\\"Знайка, однако ж, не был согласен ни с вулканической, ни с метеоритной теорией.\\\" But this is a statement, not a dialogue between two characters. \\n\\nWait, the second paragraph says \\\"Однажды он вместе со Стекляшкиным наблюдал Луну в телескоп,\\\" which means Znayka was with Steklyashkin. But there's no dialogue mentioned between them. The task requires a dialogue, so maybe there's a conversation. However, in the given text, there's no explicit dialogue. The only mention is their observation, but no actual exchange of words between them. \\n\\nSince there's no dialogue between two named characters in the provided batch, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\". But wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first paragraph mentions two groups of astronomers, but no dialogue. The second paragraph has Znayka and Steklyashkin, but no dialogue. So no evidence found. Therefore, the answer is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1089,\"completion_tokens\":388,\"total_tokens\":1477}}\n",
