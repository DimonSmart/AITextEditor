The user wants the first mention of Фуксия and Селедочка. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence, with the pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\". But in the current batch, the items are pointers 15, 16, 17. None of these pointers are in the recentEvidencePointers list, so I need to check each item's markdown for the names.\\n\\nLooking at the first item's markdown: it's about lunar craters and volcanoes. No mention of the names. The second item talks about a volcano being a large mountain with a small crater. Still nothing. The third item starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\", which translates to \\\"Meteorites said...\\\" but no names here either. \\n\\nSince none of the current batch items contain Фуксия or Селедочка, there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there's no match found in this batch. The user might have more batches coming, so we keep looking.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":800,\"completion_tokens\":243,\"total_tokens\":1043}}\n",
