The user wants me to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch. The snapshot shows that there are already 2 pieces of evidence, and the recent pointers are 8:1.1.1.p5 and 70:1.1.1.p67. But the current batch starts with pointer 84:1.2.1, which is a heading, and then two paragraphs.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (85:1.2.1.p1), the markdown text mentions \\\"фельетонов, то есть шутливых статеек, в которых рассказывалось о разных забавных приключениях лунных коротышек.\\\" There's no mention of \\\"Фуксии\\\" here. The second paragraph (86:1.2.1.p2) is truncated, so I can't check that. The heading (84:1.2.1) also doesn't have the term. \\n\\nSince none of the current batch items contain \\\"Фуксии,\\\" there are no new evidence points to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the task is to find mentions, and none are present in this batch. Also, the user mentioned that if no new evidence is found, the decision is \\\"not_found.\\\" So the correct output is to set decision to \\\"not_found\\\" with an empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1079,\"completion_tokens\":330,\"total_tokens\":1409}}\n",
