The goal is to find the first direct dialogue with two named characters in the same sentence. The context mentions examples like \\\"Alice says to Bob: Hello\\\" or \\\"John: Hi, Mary!\\\" So I need to look for instances where two named characters are having a direct conversation in the same sentence.\\n\\nFirst, I'll check the provided batch items. The only item here is a paragraph from a Russian text, which talks about Znayka returning to the Flower City and his stories about his journey. The paragraph mentions the astronomer Steklyashkin and describes the lunar surface, but there's no dialogue here. The text is narrative, not a conversation between characters. \\n\\nSince there's no direct dialogue with two named characters in this paragraph, there's no evidence to report. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and the task's maxEvidenceCount is 1. However, since the current batch doesn't contain any qualifying evidence, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". I need to make sure not to include any pointers from the recentEvidencePointers since there are none. Also, the output must be a JSON object with the decision and newEvidence array. Since there's no evidence, newEvidence will be empty. So the final response is \\\"not_found\\\" with an empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":964,\"completion_tokens\":288,\"total_tokens\":1252}}\n",
