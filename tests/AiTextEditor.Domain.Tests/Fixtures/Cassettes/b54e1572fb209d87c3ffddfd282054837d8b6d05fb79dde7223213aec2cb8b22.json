The task is to find mentions of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" excluding headings. The user provided a batch of items, each with a pointer, itemType, and markdown content. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through each item's markdown to see if \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" is mentioned. Since the itemType includes Paragraph and ListItem, I should focus on those. Headings are probably not in the markdown here, but the user said to exclude them anyway.\\n\\nLooking at the first item's markdown: It talks about Знайка, Фуксией, Селёдочкой, and the Moon, but no mention of профессор Звёздочкин. The second paragraph mentions Стекляшкин, but again, not the professor. The third paragraph discusses the origin of lunar craters, still no match. The fourth paragraph has Знайка and Стекляшкин observing the Moon, but again, no professor. \\n\\nNone of the provided markdowns mention \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers are empty, so even if there were previous matches, they aren't in this batch. Since the task requires finding mentions and there are none in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The newEvidence array remains empty because there's no relevant content. I need to make sure not to include any pointers from the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers, but since the snapshot is empty, that's not an issue here. So the final output is \\\"not_found\\\" with an empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1673,\"completion_tokens\":355,\"total_tokens\":2028}}\n",
