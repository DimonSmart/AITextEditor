The task is to find mentions of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" excluding headings. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so we need to look through the current batch.\\n\\nLooking at the items, the first few are headings, which we should ignore. The third item is a heading too: \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". Wait, the task says to exclude headings, so even though it mentions the professor, it's a heading, so we can't include it. \\n\\nNext, the paragraphs. The first paragraph (4:1.1.1.p1) talks about Незнайка's trip and the changes in the city, but no mention of the professor. The second paragraph (5:1.1.1.p2) mentions the factory built by инженера Клёпки, but again, no professor. The third paragraph (6:1.1.1.p3) is about Пончик and his clothes, still no mention. The fourth paragraph (7:1.1.1.p4) continues the story of Пончик's smell problem, but again, no professor.\\n\\nWait, the heading \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\" is a heading, so even though it mentions the professor, it's excluded. So there's no mention in the paragraphs either. Therefore, the answer should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there's no evidence in the current batch. The user might have expected the heading to count, but the rules say to exclude headings. So the correct decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1880,\"completion_tokens\":368,\"total_tokens\":2248}}\n",
