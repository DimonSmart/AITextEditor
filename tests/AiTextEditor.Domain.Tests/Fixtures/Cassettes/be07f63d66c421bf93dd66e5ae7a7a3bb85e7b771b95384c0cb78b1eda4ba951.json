The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with exactly two character names followed by dialogue markers. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items. The first item is a paragraph with a question, but it's just one character (Знайка) speaking, maybe? Wait, the first paragraph starts with \\\"– Для чего...\\\" which might be a dialogue line. But does it have two names? Let me check again. The first paragraph's markdown is \\\"– Для чего понадобилась ещё эта блинистая теория, если и без того ясно, что лунные кратеры – это просто вулканы?\\\" It seems like a single line of dialogue, possibly from Знайка, but there's no second name here. \\n\\nThe second item is \\\"Знайка отвечал, что вулкан – это очень большая гора...\\\" Here, \\\"Знайка\\\" is the speaker, but again, only one name. The third item is \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\" which is a group, but again, only one name. \\n\\nWait, maybe the first paragraph is part of a dialogue where someone else is speaking? But the way it's written, it's a single line. The task requires exactly two character names followed by dialogue markers. Since none of the items have two names, maybe there's no evidence here. But the user's snapshot has evidenceCount 0, so maybe the answer is that there's no evidence found. But the user's task says to find the first dialog between two named characters. Since none of the items in the current batch have two names, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\". However, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The first paragraph starts with a dash, which might indicate a dialogue line, but it's only one speaker. The second paragraph has \\\"Знайка\\\" as the speaker, and the third has \\\"Метеоритчики\\\" as a group. So no two names. Therefore, the answer is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":804,\"completion_tokens\":472,\"total_tokens\":1276}}\n",
