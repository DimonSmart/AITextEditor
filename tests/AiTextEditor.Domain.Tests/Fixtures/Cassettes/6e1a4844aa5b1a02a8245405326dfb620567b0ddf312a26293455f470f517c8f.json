The cursor query returned a pointer with heading title maybe to the section title. Need to get actual text. Perhaps need to use GetNextPortion? Actually we have whole book cursor. Could fetch portions and search manually? The pointer seems to be a LinearPointer: HeadingTitle is the heading where occurrence appears, line index within the heading? Need to retrieve that line. Use GetNextPortion? The pointer likely refers to a location within the book. Could use DescribePointer but error. Maybe different pointer format: SemanticPointer? Might need to request pointer decode differently? The tool expects pointer JSON of a specific shape. Our pointer has HeadingTitle and LineIndex. Maybe missing other fields like FilePath? Could still decode manually? Could attempt to query with instruction to retrieve text at that pointer location.\\n\\nWe can ask NavigationPlugin_GetNextPortion?
