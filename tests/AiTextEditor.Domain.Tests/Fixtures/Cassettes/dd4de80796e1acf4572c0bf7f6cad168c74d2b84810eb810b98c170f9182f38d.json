The goal is to find the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The context is paragraphs with dialogue markers mentioning Znayka and Professor. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so no previous matches. The batch has two paragraphs. Let me check each one.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (4:1.1.1.p1), it talks about Znayka's journey to the Sun City and the changes in the Flower City. There's mention of the professor, but no dialogue. The second paragraph (5:1.1.1.p2) discusses the construction projects and a factory. Again, no dialogue markers here. \\n\\nWait, the task specifies looking for dialogue markers. The paragraphs don't have any quotes or dialogue tags like \\\"said Znayka\\\" or \\\"the professor remarked.\\\" The mentions of Znayka and the professor are just narrative, not direct quotes. Since there's no dialogue, there's no sarcastic comment here. \\n\\nSo, neither of the paragraphs in the current batch contain the required evidence. The answer should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the conditions aren't met. No new evidence to add, and the decision is to continue or not_found. Since there's no match, the correct decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1273,\"completion_tokens\":309,\"total_tokens\":1582}}\n",
