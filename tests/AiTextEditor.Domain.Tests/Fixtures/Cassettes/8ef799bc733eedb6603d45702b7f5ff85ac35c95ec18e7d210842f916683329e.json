The user wants to find the second mention of Professor Zvezdokin, excluding headers. The task is in Russian, so I need to make sure I'm looking for the right term. First, I'll check each paragraph in the provided batch items.\\n\\nLooking at the pointers and excerpts, I see that the first mention of Professor Zvezdokin isn't here. Wait, the user mentioned \\\"второе упоминание\\\" which is the second mention. But in the given batch, I don't see any mention of Professor Zvezdokin at all. All the paragraphs are about Znayka's theories about the Moon's surface and the lunar craters. There's no reference to a professor named Zvezdokin here. \\n\\nThe snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and the recentEvidencePointers are empty. Since the task is to find the second mention, but there's none in this batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" only if there are no more batches. However, the hasMoreBatches is true, so maybe there are more batches coming. But according to the rules, if the current batch has no candidates, and there are more batches, we should continue scanning. But the user's instruction says that \\\"not_found\\\" is only when hasMoreBatches is false and evidenceCount is 0. Since hasMoreBatches is true here, the correct decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there might be more batches with the mention. However, the user's task might require stopping if there's no evidence in the current batch. Wait, the decision policy says \\\"not_found\\\" is allowed only when hasMoreBatches is false and evidenceCount is 0. Since hasMoreBatches is true, even if current batch has no evidence, we should continue. Therefore, the decision is \\\"continue\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2080,\"completion_tokens\":401,\"total_tokens\":2481}}\n",
