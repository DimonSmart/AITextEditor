Likely need to run cursor_agent to extract characters. But earlier attempts didn't produce evidence. Maybe need to use cursor_create_filtered_cursor with filterDescription to find paragraphs containing character names. But we already used keyword cursor. But the cursor didn't return items? Wait, kwd_cursor_2 returned items earlier with heading and paragraphs. But after update, get_character_dossiers returned empty. Maybe the update didn't parse? The system may require to run cursor_agent after creating cursor to extract. But we did. But still empty. Maybe need to use character_dossiers_generate_character_dossiers again after update? We did. But still empty. Maybe the tool expects to run cursor_agent with taskDescription \\\"Extract character information from the book\\\" but we didn't provide context? We did. But still no evidence. Maybe the cursor didn't produce evidence because the tool didn't parse? Could be that the cursor didn't include headings? But we set includeHeadings true. But maybe the cursor didn't return items because the book is large and we didn't read all? But we read all items earlier. The cursor returned items. But update didn't parse. Maybe the system expects to use cursor_agent with \\\"Extract character information from the book\\\" but we need to provide the cursorName and context. We did. But still no evidence. Maybe the cursor_agent didn't run because we didn't provide maxEvidenceCount? But that's optional. But maybe the cursor_agent didn't produce evidence because the book is too large? But we had items. But maybe the cursor_agent didn't find any characters because the tool expects to parse names from text. But we didn't provide any names. But we used keyword cursor with names. But the agent might not parse. Maybe we need to use cursor_create_filtered_cursor with filterDescription that matches paragraphs containing \\\"Незнайка\\\" etc. But we already did. But maybe the agent didn't parse because we didn't provide a context? We did. Hmm.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the system expects to use character_dossiers_generate_character_dossiers after scanning the entire book. But we did. But still empty. Maybe we need to run cursor_agent with \\\"Extract character information from the book\\\" but with cursorName from fullscan cursor. We did. But still empty.\\n\\nMaybe the issue is that the cursor_agent didn't produce evidence because the book is too large and the agent didn't find any characters. But we saw paragraphs with names. But maybe the agent didn't parse because the text is in Russian and the tool expects English? But likely fine.\\n\\nMaybe we need to manually create dossiers using upsert. But the user asked to create catalog using tools. We can manually create dossiers for known characters: Незнайка, Кнопочки, Пачкули, Вертибутылкина, Клёпки, Пончик, Фуксия, Селёдочка, Стекляшкин, Звёздочкин. We can upsert each. Provide aliasExamples maybe.
