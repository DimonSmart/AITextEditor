The user wants me to find the first dialogue between two named characters and name them. First, I need to figure out how to approach this using the provided tools.\\n\\nThe user mentioned using the cursor-create_cursor function to create a named cursor for filtering. Since the task is about finding dialogues, I should set the filterDescription to something like \\\"All paragraphs\\\" to ensure I don't miss any parts. The cursor name could be \\\"dialogue_cursor\\\".\\n\\nNext, I'll need to run the agent using agent-run_agent with the cursorName and a taskDescription that asks for the first dialogue between two named characters. The agent will process the document in portions, so I might need to call run_agent multiple times until it finds the answer or indicates there's no more data.\\n\\nWait, the user specified that if the agent returns \\\"not_found\\\" but there are more items, I should continue with the same cursor. So I need to loop until the status is \\\"cursor_complete\\\" or the answer is found. Also, I have to check previous evidence in case the answer is in a previous portion.\\n\\nI should also be careful about different dialogue formats. The user mentioned looking for \\\"Name: Text\\\", \\\"Name said, \\\"Text\\\"\\\", or paragraphs starting with dashes where context implies different speakers. So the filter should capture all these variations.\\n\\nLet me start by creating the cursor with the filterDescription set to \\\"All paragraphs\\\" to cover all possible dialogue formats. Then, run the agent with the task to find the first occurrence of two named characters in a dialogue. If the first result is found, return their names. If not, continue scanning until the cursor completes or the answer is found.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_o60j4rec\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"All paragraphs\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"maxElements\\\":1000,\\\"name\\\":\\\"dialogue_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":950,\"completion_tokens\":404,\"total_tokens\":1354}}\n",
