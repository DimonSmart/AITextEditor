The user wants the first mention of Professor Zvezdochkin where he's described as \\\"кипевший от негодования\\\" (boiling with indignation) and a brief character description.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan the current batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, but the user is asking for the first occurrence. The recentEvidencePointers include \\\"24:1.1.1.p21\\\", but that's from a previous batch, so I should ignore that.\\n\\nLooking through the items in the current batch, the relevant part is in pointer 70:1.1.1.p67. The markdown there mentions that Professor Zvezdochkin was not very satisfied and that he jumped onto the tribune and said something. The key part is \\\"кипевший от негодования\\\" which translates to \\\"boiling with indignation.\\\" The excerpt says he was not very satisfied and jumped up, indicating his frustration. The reason would be that he's described as being in a state of indignation, showing he's easily agitated or strict. \\n\\nI need to make sure not to include any pointers from the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers. The current batch's items don't have any other mentions of the professor in the same context. So the correct pointer is 70:1.1.1.p67. The excerpt is copied exactly, and the reason is that he's described as being in a state of indignation, indicating his character as strict or easily annoyed.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2232,\"completion_tokens\":474,\"total_tokens\":2706}}\n",
