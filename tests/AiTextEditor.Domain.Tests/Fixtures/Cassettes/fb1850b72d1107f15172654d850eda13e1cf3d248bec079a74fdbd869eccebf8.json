The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the current batch. First, I need to check each item's markdown content carefully. \\n\\nLooking at the first item, pointer 33:1.1.1.p30, the markdown is about a professor mentioning weightlessness. No 'Фуксии' here. \\n\\nNext, pointer 34:1.1.1.p31. The paragraph talks about a bottle of water in a rocket, weightlessness, and water behaving oddly. Still, no mention of Фуксии. \\n\\nThen, pointer 35:1.1.1.p32. The markdown here has Звёздочкин complaining about comparing a bottle to a planet. Again, no Фуксии. \\n\\nWait, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers includes \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch items don't have any references to Фуксии. So, there are no new evidence pointers to add. \\n\\nThe decision should be 'not_found' since there's no mention in the current batch. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 10, but since we can't find any new evidence, the decision is not_found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":993,\"completion_tokens\":288,\"total_tokens\":1281}}\n",
