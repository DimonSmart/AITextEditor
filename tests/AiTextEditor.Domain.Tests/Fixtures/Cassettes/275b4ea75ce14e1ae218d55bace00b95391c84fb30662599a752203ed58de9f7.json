The task is to check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different. Then return the names and the dialogue text.\\n\\nFirst, I need to look at the current batch items. The batch has three paragraphs. Let me check each one.\\n\\nFirst item: pointer \\\"33:1.1.1.p30\\\", markdown is \\\"– При чём тут ещё состояние невесомости? – буркнул профессор.\\\" So this starts with a dash, then the dialogue, then \\\"буркнул профессор.\\\" So the speaker is профессор (professor), but the format here is \\\"– [dialogue] – [speaker action]\\\". Wait, the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". But in this case, the paragraph starts with a dash, then the dialogue, then the speaker's action. So the actual name isn't at the start followed by a colon. Let me check the exact structure.\\n\\nThe markdown for 33:1.1.1.p30 is \\\"– При чём тут ещё состояние невесомости? – буркнул профессор.\\\" So the structure is: dash, dialogue, dash, then speaker action. So the speaker's name (профессор) comes after the second dash, but not at the very start of the paragraph. The paragraph starts with a dash, not the name. So maybe this doesn't count as starting with the name followed by a colon.\\n\\nNext item: pointer \\\"34:1.1.1.p31\\\", markdown \\\"– А вот при чём, – сказал Знайка. – Да будет вам известно, что во время полёта в ракете у меня была бутылка с водой...\\\" So again, starts with a dash, then dialogue, then \\\"сказал Знайка.\\\" So the speaker's name (Знайка) is after the second dash. So again, the paragraph starts with a dash, not the name followed by colon.\\n\\nThird item: pointer \\\"35:1.1.1.p32\\\", markdown \\\"– Попал пальцем в небо! – сердито проворчал Звёздочкин. – Сравнил бутылку с планетой! По-вашему, это научно?\\\" Same structure: dash, dialogue, dash, speaker action (сердито проворчал Звёздочкин). So speaker name is Звёздочкин, but again, not at the start of the paragraph followed by colon.\\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So maybe the paragraph should start with the name and then a colon. For example, \\\"Знайка: [dialogue]\\\". But in the current batch, all the paragraphs start with a dash, then dialogue, then the speaker's action. So the name is part of the action phrase, not at the beginning followed by colon.\\n\\nSo for example, in the first paragraph: \\\"– При чём тут ещё состояние невесомости? – буркнул профессор.\\\" The speaker is профессор, but the paragraph starts with a dash, not the name. So the name is in the middle of the paragraph. Similarly for the others.\\n\\nTherefore, none of these paragraphs start with a character's name followed by a colon. They all start with a dash, then dialogue, then the speaker's action. So maybe the task is looking for something like \\\"Знайка: [text]\\\" but in this case, the format is different.\\n\\nSo the current batch items don't have any paragraphs that start with a character's name followed by a colon. The structure here is using dashes for dialogue, with the speaker mentioned after the dialogue. So perhaps the task's requirement isn't met here.\\n\\nWait, but maybe the task considers \\\"буркнул профессор\\\" as part of the structure. But the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So the very first part of the paragraph should be the name and then a colon. For example, \\\"Профессор: При чём тут ещё состояние невесомости?\\\" But in the given data, it's \\\"– При чём тут ещё состояние невесомости? – буркнул профессор.\\\" So the name is after the dialogue, not at the start.\\n\\nTherefore, none of the paragraphs in this batch start with a character's name followed by a colon. So there's no evidence here. But wait, maybe the task is looking for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a name followed by colon. But in this case, none of them do. So the decision would be \\\"continue\\\" because there's no new evidence, but since the task is to check for such consecutive paragraphs, and there are none in this batch, but maybe there could be in future batches. However, the current batch has no matches.\\n\\nWait, but the task says \\\"Check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different.\\\" So each paragraph must start with a name followed by colon. But in the current batch, all paragraphs start with a dash, so they don't meet the criteria. So no new evidence here.\\n\\nBut let's check again. Let's look at each paragraph's markdown:\\n\\n33:1.1.1.p30: \\\"– При чём тут ещё состояние невесомости? – буркнул профессор.\\\" So starts with \\\"– \\\", then dialogue, then \\\"– буркнул профессор.\\\" So the first character is a dash, not a name.\\n\\n34:1.1.1.p31: \\\"– А вот при чём, – сказал Знайка. – Да будет вам известно...\\\" Again starts with dash.\\n\\n35:1.1.1.p32: \\\"– Попал пальцем в небо! – сердито проворчал Звёздочкин. – Сравнил бутылку с планетой! По-вашему, это научно?\\\" Same structure.\\n\\nSo none of these start with a character's name followed by colon. So there's no evidence here. Therefore, newEvidence should be empty. But the decision would be \\\"continue\\\" because there's more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), and we haven't found enough evidence (but since maxEvidenceCount is null, maybe we just keep going until we find some or all batches are processed).\\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\": null, so no maximum. So we need to keep checking until we find some evidence. But in this batch, there's no evidence. So newEvidence is empty. Then decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), and we haven't found any evidence yet.\\n\\nBut according to the output schema, if there's no new evidence, then newEvidence is an empty list. And decision is \\\"continue\\\" if there are more batches, or \\\"done\\\" if maxEvidenceCount is reached. Since maxEvidenceCount is null, and evidenceCount is 0, and newEvidence is empty, then decision is \\\"continue\\\".\\n\\nWait, but the rules say: if 'maxEvidenceCount' is provided and snapshot.evidenceCount + newEvidence.length \\u003e= maxEvidenceCount, then decision=\\\"done\\\". But here maxEvidenceCount is null, so that condition doesn't apply. So if there's no new evidence, but there are more batches, then decision is \\\"continue\\\".\\n\\nYes. So in this case, since the current batch has no matching evidence, newEvidence is empty list, and decision is \\\"continue\\\".\\n\\nBut wait, the task says \\\"Check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different.\\\" So consecutive paragraphs each starting with name:... and different names. But in the current batch, none of the paragraphs start with name followed by colon. So no matches. So newEvidence is empty.\\n\\nSo the output should be:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\",\\n  \\\"newEvidence\\\": []\\n}\\n\\nBut let me check again. Are there any possible matches here? For example, maybe the \\\"буркнул профессор\\\" part is considered as the start? But no, the paragraph starts with a dash. The first character is \\\"–\\\", which is a dash. So the name is not at the start. So no.\\n\\nAnother angle: maybe the task considers the speaker's name followed by a colon even if it's part of the dialogue structure. But the example given in the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So for example, \\\"Знайка: [text]\\\". But in the current data, it's \\\"– [text] – буркнул профессор.\\\" So the speaker is mentioned after the dialogue, not at the start. So the structure is different. So no matches here.\\n\\nTherefore, newEvidence is empty. Decision is \\\"continue\\\" because hasMoreBatches is true.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1009,\"completion_tokens\":1958,\"total_tokens\":2967}}\n",
