The user wants the first mention of Professor Zvezdokin and then rewrite the paragraph, adding that the apple trees started to bloom at that moment.\\n\\nFirst, I need to find the first occurrence of Professor Zvezdokin in the document. Since the user mentioned using the cursor approach, I should create a cursor to search for mentions of him. The function cursor-create_cursor is the right tool here. The filterDescription should look for the name \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\". \\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, I'll run the agent to get the first evidence item. The agent-run_agent function with the cursor name and task description to find the first mention. I need to set maxEvidenceCount to 1 to stop after the first occurrence. \\n\\nAfter retrieving the paragraph, I have to check if it's the first mention. If it is, then I need to add the part about the apple trees blooming. But wait, the user wants the paragraph rewritten with that addition. So I need to make sure the original paragraph is correctly identified and then append the new information. \\n\\nWait, but the user might not have the exact wording. The original text might not mention apple trees, so I need to ensure that the addition is seamlessly integrated. Also, I should check if the first mention is indeed in the first evidence item. If the first item has multiple mentions, I need to confirm it's the first occurrence. \\n\\nOnce the correct paragraph is found, I'll rewrite it, adding the part about the apple trees. Then, I need to present the result in Russian, including the semantic pointer as specified. If the document doesn't have the mention, I should inform the user. \\n\\nLet me structure the steps: create the cursor, run the agent to get the first mention, check the evidence, then rewrite the paragraph with the added detail. Make sure to use the functions provided and follow the guidelines for using cursors and agents.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_2b8iynk4\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"Contains 'профессора Звёздочкина'\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1084,\"completion_tokens\":454,\"total_tokens\":1538}}\n",
