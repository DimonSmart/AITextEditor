The task is to find the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the given context. The user provided a snapshot with evidenceCount 1 and recentEvidencePointers including \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". But the current batch has items starting from pointer 48:1.1.1.p45 onwards.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan each item in the current batch. The items are paragraphs 45, 46, 47. Looking at their markdown content:\\n\\n- Paragraph 45: \\\"– Верно! Правильно! Молодец, Знайка! Ура!\\\" – No mention of Пончик here.\\n- Paragraph 46: \\\"Все захлопали в ладоши. Кто-то крикнул:\\\" – Still nothing.\\n- Paragraph 47: \\\"– Долой Звёздочкина!\\\" – Also no Пончик.\\n\\nNone of these paragraphs contain the term \\\"Пончик\\\". The snapshot's recent evidence pointer was from a previous batch, but the current batch doesn't have any new evidence. Since the task is to find the first mention and the current batch doesn't have it, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, since there's no new evidence to add, the newEvidence array remains empty. The maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't need to check for a threshold here. Therefore, the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":706,\"completion_tokens\":333,\"total_tokens\":1039}}\n",
