The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the provided batch. First, I need to scan each item's markdown content carefully. \\n\\nLooking at the first item, the markdown talks about the Moon's surface and bubbles, but I don't see 'Фуксии' here. The second paragraph mentions astronomers and vulcanologists laughing at Znayka's theory, still no match. The third paragraph starts with \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\" which is about vulcanologists, but again, no 'Фуксии'.\\n\\nWait, the task's context says the content contains 'Фуксии', but in the given batch items, I don't see that word anywhere. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", which isn't in the current batch. Since the current batch doesn't have any mentions of 'Фуксии', the decision should be 'not_found'. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't stop early. Therefore, the output is 'not_found' with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1088,\"completion_tokens\":251,\"total_tokens\":1339}}\n",
