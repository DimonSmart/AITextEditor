The user is asking about Фуксия (Fuchsia) and Селедочка (Seldochka) and where they are first mentioned. First, I need to figure out how to find this information in the provided document.\\n\\nSince the user mentioned using the CursorAgentPlugin-run_cursor_agent function, I should use that. The task is to find the first mentions of these names. The function requires a taskDescription. The user wants to know who these characters are and their first appearance. \\n\\nI should structure the taskDescription to search for the first occurrence of either \\\"Фуксия\\\" or \\\"Селедочка\\\". Maybe start by looking for the first mention of either name. The function will then scan the document and return the relevant paragraph. \\n\\nWait, the user specified that if the book doesn't have the answer, I should say it's not found. So I need to make sure the function is called correctly. The parameters include taskDescription, which should be a natural language task. So the task would be something like \\\"Find the first mention of Фуксия and Селедочка in the text.\\\"\\n\\nI should call the run_cursor_agent function with this taskDescription. The context and startAfterPointer are optional, but since it's the first query, maybe leave them out. The function will then process the document and return the first occurrence. \\n\\nOnce the function returns the result, I can extract the paragraph where they are first mentioned and present it in Russian, including the semantic pointer if applicable. If the function doesn't find anything, I'll have to inform the user that the information isn't in the document.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_gbzzue2k\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"CursorAgentPlugin-run_cursor_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Найти первое упоминание Фуксии и Селедочки в тексте\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":361,\"completion_tokens\":391,\"total_tokens\":752}}\n",
