The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided a batch of text which is a paragraph discussing lunar craters and two theories about their origin: volcanic and meteorite. The paragraph mentions astronomers splitting into two groups but doesn't mention Professor Zvezdokhin at all. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and the afterPointer is 10:1.1.1.p7. Since the current batch doesn't have any mention of the professor, the decision should be 'continue' because there's no evidence here. The user might have more batches coming, so we need to keep scanning. The JSON should reflect that no evidence was found in this batch, so newEvidence is empty, and decision is continue.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":648,\"completion_tokens\":182,\"total_tokens\":830}}\n",
