The user is asking about the visualization of a lunar crater depicted as a huge round field with an earth embankment along the edge. First, I need to figure out how to approach this using the provided tools.\\n\\nThe user wants to know where in the document this description is mentioned. Since the tools allow creating a cursor and running an agent to search through the document, I should start by creating a cursor that looks for mentions related to the lunar crater's visualization. The filter description should be stateless, so I can't use counters or track occurrences. Instead, I'll look for keywords like \\\"визуализация\\\", \\\"лунный кратер\\\", \\\"круглого поля\\\", and \\\"земляной вал\\\".\\n\\nI'll create a cursor named \\\"search_cursor\\\" with the filter description in Russian, as the document is likely in Russian. Then, I'll run the agent with this cursor, specifying the task to find the first mention. The maxEvidenceCount can be set to 1 to stop after the first result. \\n\\nWait, but the user might need the exact paragraph. So after creating the cursor, I'll run the agent and check the evidence items. If the first item contains the description, that's the answer. If not, I'll need to iterate further. However, since the user is asking for the first mention, setting maxEvidenceCount to 1 makes sense. \\n\\nI should also remember to check the previous evidence if needed, but since this is the first step, it's probably in the initial results. Once the agent returns the evidence, I'll extract the pointer label and the relevant paragraph to provide the answer in Russian.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_1n9wm73p\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"Contains the term 'визуализация лунного кратера' and describes it as 'огромного круглого поля с земляным валом по краю'\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1078,\"completion_tokens\":427,\"total_tokens\":1505}}\n",
