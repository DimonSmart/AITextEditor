The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that we should look for direct speech markers like quotes or dashes. The user provided a batch of three paragraphs.\\n\\nFirst, I'll scan each paragraph for any direct dialogue. The first paragraph (18:1.1.1.p15) is a statement without any dialogue markers. The second paragraph (19:1.1.1.p16) has \\\"На это Знайка отвечал...\\\" which translates to \\\"Znayka answered...\\\" but it's a narrative, not a direct quote. The third paragraph (20:1.1.1.p17) has \\\"Они говорили, что вообще смешно...\\\" which is a reported speech, not direct dialogue. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The second paragraph mentions Знайка (Znayka) speaking, but it's in the past tense and part of a narrative. The third paragraph has \\\"Они говорили...\\\" which is third-person reporting. There's no direct dialogue between two named characters here. The task requires direct speech markers, so none of these paragraphs have that. Therefore, there's no evidence to report. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":899,\"completion_tokens\":286,\"total_tokens\":1185}}\n",
