Return every paragraph where a person appears. Use evidence.pointer and evidence.excerpt exactly from batch items.\\\"\\n\\nWe need to output a JSON with fields decision, semanticPointerFrom, excerpt, whyThis, markdown, summary.\\n\\nWe have aggregated evidence. We need decide if task resolved. The task wants to collect all paragraphs where a person appears. The evidence seems to include many paragraphs with character mentions. The requirement: \\\"Return every paragraph where a person appears. Use evidence.pointer and evidence.excerpt exactly from batch items.\\\"\\n\\nThus we need to output success and include one paragraph? Wait schema: fields: decision, semanticPointerFrom, excerpt, whyThis, markdown, summary. It seems we must output a single JSON that maybe encapsulates the result. But the task requires returning every paragraph. However the system expects a single JSON, not a list. Possibly we need to return the aggregated result as a single string maybe in summary? The schema: \\\"semanticPointerFrom\\\" a pointer, \\\"excerpt\\\" the excerpt, \\\"markdown\\\" same as excerpt, \\\"summary\\\" maybe a summary of all? But can't include all because only one excerpt allowed. The instruction: \\\"Return every paragraph where a person appears. Use evidence.pointer and evidence.excerpt exactly from batch items.\\\" Perhaps they expect we list multiple items? But schema doesn't allow array. Could maybe we set decision=success and provide a concatenated list in summary? However they require excerpt must be copied verbatim from chosen evidence excerpt. So we must choose one evidence to represent? Usually these tasks have you pick one relevant excerpt. But the task asked for all. Might be ambiguous. According to prior pattern, when multiple needed, we might set decision=success and include the first relevant? But they'd likely want not_found if can't provide all.\\n\\nGiven constraints, we cannot list all paragraphs within single JSON fields unless we concatenate them in summary field. \\\"markdown\\\" must be copied from chosen evidence excerpt (verbatim). So we need pick one excerpt to satisfy markdown.\\n\\nThus we need decide if we can fulfill. Since we cannot include all, but we can still provide success with a representative. However the instruction: \\\"Return every paragraph where a person appears.\\\" This cannot be satisfied with single excerpt. Therefore perhaps decision should be not_found because we cannot return all.\\n\\nGiven the system, we must follow rules: If cannot provide requested output, return not_found.\\n\\nThus decision = \\\"not_found\\\". For not_found, other fields maybe empty? Schema says must include fields but maybe can leave empty strings. Likely all fields required; we can set empty for others.\\n\\nThus produce JSON with decision not_found, other fields empty strings.\\n\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":8420,\"completion_tokens\":617,\"total_tokens\":9037}}\n",
