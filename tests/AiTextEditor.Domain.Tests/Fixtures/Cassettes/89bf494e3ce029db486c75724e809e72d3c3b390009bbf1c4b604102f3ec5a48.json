The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions looking for direct speech markers like quotes or dashes. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once we find one, we should stop.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (8:1.1.1.p5), there's a lot of narrative but no direct dialogue. The characters mentioned are Знайка, Фуксией, and Селёдочкой, but their interactions are described in third person. No quotes or dialogue indicators here.\\n\\nNow, the second paragraph (9:1.1.1.p6) talks about Знайка's return and his stories. The astronomer Стекляшкин is mentioned, but again, it's all narrative. There's no direct dialogue between any two named characters. The sentences are all in third person, describing actions and observations without any quotes or dialogue markers.\\n\\nSince neither paragraph has direct speech between named characters, the answer would be that no evidence was found. But wait, the user said to output exactly one JSON object. If there's no evidence, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". But the rules say to report all matches. Since there are none, the newEvidence array is empty, and decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1309,\"completion_tokens\":284,\"total_tokens\":1593}}\n",
