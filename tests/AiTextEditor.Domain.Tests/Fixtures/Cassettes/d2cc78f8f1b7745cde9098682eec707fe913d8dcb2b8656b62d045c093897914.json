I need to find the last paragraph under the second chapter heading.\\n\\nFirst, I created a cursor to filter for paragraphs that are the last under the second chapter. Then, I ran the agent to find the last one. The response came back with the excerpt: \\\"The second chapter ends with a cliffhanger about the hidden door.\\\" \\n\\nSince the cursor is complete and the evidence is found, I should present this excerpt as the answer. Make sure to mention the pointer label for reference. The user wanted the answer in English, so I'll translate the excerpt if needed, but it's already in English. Just need to format the response correctly with the pointer.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1245,\"completion_tokens\":173,\"total_tokens\":1418}}\n",
