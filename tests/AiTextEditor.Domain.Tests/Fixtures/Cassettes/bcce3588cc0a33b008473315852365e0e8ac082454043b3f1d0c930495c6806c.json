The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with character names followed by dialogue markers. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, both are paragraphs. The first paragraph talks about Ponchik and others, but there's no dialogue here. The second paragraph mentions Ponchik and others, but again, no direct dialogue. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The task says \\\"Lines containing character names followed by dialogue markers,\\\" so maybe the dialogue is indicated by something like \\\"said\\\" or a colon. Let me check again.\\n\\nIn the first paragraph, there's \\\"Пончик увидел...\\\" which is a narrative, not dialogue. The second paragraph has \\\"Пончику приходилось ежедневно травить её нафталином...\\\" which is also narrative. No direct dialogue between two characters here. The snapshot has evidenceCount 0, so maybe there's no evidence in this batch. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there's no dialogue between two named characters in the current batch items.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1282,\"completion_tokens\":258,\"total_tokens\":1540}}\n",
