The task is to find the second mention of Professor Zvezdokin, excluding headers. The user provided a snapshot with evidenceCount 0 and no recent pointers. The current batch has several paragraphs.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan each item's markdown for any reference to Professor Zvezdokin. Since the task is about the second occurrence, I have to check each paragraph carefully. \\n\\nLooking through the items, the first paragraph mentions Znayka, but not Zvezdokin. The next paragraphs discuss volcanologists and meteoritologists, but no mention of the professor. The same goes for the following paragraphs. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. \\n\\nWait, the user's task is about Professor Zvezdokin, but in the provided batch items, there's no mention of that name. All the references are to Znayka, volcanologists, meteoritologists, and lunar features. There's no mention of Professor Zvezdokin here. So, according to the evidence rules, if there's no match in the current batch, and the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, then the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". But the user's instruction says to output exactly one JSON object. Since there's no evidence in the current batch, the newEvidence array would be empty, and the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\" because the task requires finding the second mention, but none exists here. However, the user's snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and the current batch has no matches. Therefore, the correct decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2405,\"completion_tokens\":344,\"total_tokens\":2749}}\n",
