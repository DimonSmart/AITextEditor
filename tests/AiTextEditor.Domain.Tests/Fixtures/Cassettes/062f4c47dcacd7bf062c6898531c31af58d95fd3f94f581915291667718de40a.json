The user wants me to find the first dialogue between two named characters and name them. So first, I need to create a cursor to scan through the document.\\n\\nI already created a cursor named \\\"search_cursor\\\" with a filterDescription of \\\"true\\\", which means it'll process all paragraphs. Now I need to run the agent on this cursor to check each portion.\\n\\nThe next step is to call agent-run_agent with the cursorName \\\"search_cursor\\\" and a taskDescription. The task should be to look for dialogue between two named characters. But how to phrase the taskDescription?\\n\\nThe taskDescription needs to be something like \\\"Find the first occurrence of a dialogue between two named characters. Check for paragraphs where two different characters are speaking, using formats like 'Name: Text' or 'Name said, \\\"Text\\\"' or dashes for dialogue.\\\"\\n\\nWait, but the agent's taskDescription should specify what to look for. Since the cursor is set to process all paragraphs, the agent needs to check each paragraph for dialogue patterns.\\n\\nBut the problem is that a dialogue might span multiple paragraphs. So maybe the agent needs to check consecutive paragraphs where different characters are speaking.\\n\\nBut the cursor processes one portion at a time (10-20 items), so the agent has to check each portion for any dialogue sequences.\\n\\nThe taskDescription should instruct the agent to look for sequences where two different named characters are speaking. For example, if a paragraph starts with \\\"Alice: Hello\\\" and the next one is \\\"Bob: Hi\\\", that's a dialogue.\\n\\nBut the agent's taskDescription needs to be precise. Let me think. Maybe \\\"Check for consecutive paragraphs where two different named characters are speaking, using standard dialogue formats (e.g., 'Name: text', 'Name said, \\\"text\\\"', or dash-prefixed lines indicating speaker changes).\\\"\\n\\nBut the agent is supposed to process each portion (batch of paragraphs) and check for the first occurrence. So when running the agent, the taskDescription should be something like \\\"Find the first instance of a dialogue between two named characters. Look for speaker labels followed by text, and check if consecutive paragraphs have different speakers.\\\"\\n\\nWait, but the agent's job is to scan the current portion and see if there's a dialogue. Since the cursor is streaming, each run of the agent processes the next batch.\\n\\nSo first, I need to run agent-run_agent with cursorName \\\"search_cursor\\\" and taskDescription that tells it to look for dialogue between two named characters.\\n\\nLet me check the tools again. The agent-run_agent parameters are cursorName, maxEvidenceCount (optional), and taskDescription.\\n\\nSo the taskDescription should be something like: \\\"Identify the first dialogue between two named characters. Check for paragraphs where a character's name is followed by a colon or 'said' followed by quotes, and look for consecutive paragraphs with different speakers.\\\"\\n\\nBut maybe more precise. For example: \\\"Check for any two consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a different character's name followed by a colon or quote, indicating dialogue between them.\\\"\\n\\nAlternatively, the taskDescription could be: \\\"Find the first occurrence of a dialogue between two named characters. Look for patterns like 'Name: text' or 'Name said, \\\"text\\\"' in consecutive paragraphs.\\\"\\n\\nBut the agent needs to process each portion and check for such patterns. Since the cursor is set to process all paragraphs, the agent will check each batch.\\n\\nSo the first step is to run agent-run_agent with the cursor and the taskDescription.\\n\\nLet me structure the tool call.\\n\\nName: agent-run_agent\\n\\nArguments:\\n\\ncursorName: \\\"search_cursor\\\"\\n\\ntaskDescription: \\\"Find the first dialogue between two named characters. Check for paragraphs where a character's name is followed by a colon, 'said', or dash, and look for consecutive paragraphs with different speakers.\\\"\\n\\nmaxEvidenceCount could be set to 1 to stop after finding the first one, but maybe not necessary. The default is -1, which means process all in the batch. But since we need the first occurrence, maybe set maxEvidenceCount=1 so it stops when it finds one.\\n\\nBut the problem is that the agent might not know to stop after the first one. However, the taskDescription should specify to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nAlternatively, the agent will check the current batch and if it finds a dialogue, return it. If not, then the next batch.\\n\\nSo the first call to agent-run_agent will process the first batch. If it finds something, then we can check the response. If not, and there's more items, we need to call again.\\n\\nSo let's proceed.\\n\\nFirst, run agent-run_agent with cursorName \\\"search_cursor\\\", taskDescription as above, and maxEvidenceCount=1 to stop after first find.\\n\\nWait, but the taskDescription should be clear. Let me check the example.\\n\\nThe user wants the first dialogue between two named characters. So the agent should look for any two consecutive paragraphs where each is a different character's dialogue.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nAlice: Hello\\n\\nBob: Hi\\n\\nThat's a dialogue between Alice and Bob.\\n\\nOr:\\n\\nJohn said, \\\"How are you?\\\"\\n\\nMary replied, \\\"I'm fine.\\\"\\n\\nOr using dashes:\\n\\n- Alice: Hello\\n\\n- Bob: Hi\\n\\nSo the taskDescription should check for these patterns.\\n\\nSo the taskDescription could be: \\\"Check for consecutive paragraphs where two different named characters are speaking, using formats like 'Name: text', 'Name said, \\\"text\\\"', or dash-prefixed lines with speaker names.\\\"\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo the tool call would be:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"agent-run_agent\\\",\\n  \\\"arguments\\\": {\\n    \\\"cursorName\\\": \\\"search_cursor\\\",\\n    \\\"taskDescription\\\": \\\"Find the first dialogue between two named characters. Check for paragraphs with speaker labels (e.g., 'Name: text', 'Name said, \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"', or dash-prefixed lines indicating different speakers).\\\",\\n    \\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\": 1\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nBut maxEvidenceCount=1 would make the agent stop after finding one evidence item. Since we need the first occurrence, this is good.\\n\\nNow, when the agent runs, it will process the first batch (10-20 paragraphs) and check for such a dialogue. If found, it returns the evidence. If not, and there's more items, it returns \\\"Status: More items available\\\", and we need to call again.\\n\\nSo let's make that tool call.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_021ad7433c1f495c8a1fe340\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first dialogue between two named characters.
