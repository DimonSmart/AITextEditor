The context: \\\"paragraph contains Фуксии\\\". So we need to find mentions of the word \\\"Фуксии\\\" in paragraphs. The batch includes only headings, no paragraphs. So no evidence.\\n\\nWe must output JSON with decision: if no evidence found, maybe \\\"continue\\\" because more batches? The snapshot evidenceCount=0. No recent pointers. Since no evidence in this batch, but there are more batches, and need to continue scanning. So decision=\\\"continue\\\", newEvidence empty array.\\n\\nCheck schema: decision \\\"continue|done|not_found\\\". There's also \\\"not_found\\\" maybe when no mention anywhere? But since more batches, we continue.\\n\\nThus JSON: {\\\"decision\\\":\\\"continue\\\",\\\"newEvidence\\\":[]}\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":697,\"completion_tokens\":181,\"total_tokens\":878}}\n",
