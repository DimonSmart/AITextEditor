The user wants to find the first mention of \\\"Fuchs\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to see if \\\"Fuchs\\\" appears. \\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", the markdown content is in Russian. I'll check if \\\"Fuchs\\\" is there. The text mentions Ponчик (Ponchik) and other characters, but I don't see \\\"Fuchs\\\" here. \\n\\nNext, the second item has pointer \\\"7:1.1.1.p4\\\". Again, the text is in Russian. Scanning through, the names mentioned are Ponчик and others, but no \\\"Fuchs\\\". \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The task says \\\"first mention of Fuchs\\\", but the entire batch's markdown is in Russian. The name \\\"Fuchs\\\" is German, so maybe it's a character or a place? But in the given text, there's no mention of Fuchs. All the characters are Russian, like Ponчик, Огурцовой реке (Ogurcovaya River), etc. \\n\\nSince the user's task is to find Fuchs, but the batch doesn't have that name, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and there are no recent pointers. So, no new evidence to add. Therefore, the output should be \\\"not_found\\\" with an empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1264,\"completion_tokens\":336,\"total_tokens\":1600}}\n",
