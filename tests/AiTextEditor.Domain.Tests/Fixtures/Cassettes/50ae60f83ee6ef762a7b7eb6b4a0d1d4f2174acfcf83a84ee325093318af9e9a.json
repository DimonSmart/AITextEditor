(truncated in this code sample for brevity)\\\". We cannot assume it contains \\\"Фуксии\\\". Must only use visible content. So no mention found in this batch. Should not add evidence for pointers already in recentEvidencePointers. So output decision maybe \\\"continue\\\" if more batches? snapshot has hasMoreBatches false. No more batches. Since no new evidence found, we likely output decision \\\"done\\\" or \\\"not_found\\\"? Since goal is to find last mention, but we have no new evidence. Since no more batches, we could respond \\\"done\\\" with empty newEvidence. However maybe \\\"not_found\\\" if we haven't found any mention in this batch doesn't mean overall not found. But since hasMoreBatches false, scanning is complete. So final decision maybe \\\"done\\\". The schema allows \\\"continue|done|not_found\\\".
