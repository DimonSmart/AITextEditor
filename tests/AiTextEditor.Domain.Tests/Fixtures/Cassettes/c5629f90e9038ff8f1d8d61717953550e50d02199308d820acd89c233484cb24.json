The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokin, excluding headers. The user provided a batch of items, each with a pointer and markdown content. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through each item's markdown to see if \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" appears. Since the task says to exclude headers, I'll focus on paragraphs and list items. \\n\\nLooking at the items:\\n\\n- The first few paragraphs talk about Znayka's theories about the Moon's surface, but there's no mention of Professor Zvezdokin here.\\n- The paragraphs continue discussing volcanoes and meteorites, still no mention.\\n- Further down, paragraph 21 mentions Znayka's book where he talks about lunar inhabitants, but again, no professor.\\n- The last paragraph (23) mentions Znayka's book again, but still no professor.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each paragraph again. Oh, wait! The task is about Professor Zvezdokin, but in the provided batch, there's no mention of that name. All references are to Znayka. The user might have a different batch in mind, but based on the given data, there's no evidence of Professor Zvezdokin. \\n\\nSince the snapshot has evidenceCount 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, and the current batch doesn't have any mentions, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". No new evidence to add.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2195,\"completion_tokens\":324,\"total_tokens\":2519}}\n",
