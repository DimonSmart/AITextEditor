The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context is lines with at least two named characters in a dialogue format. The max evidence count is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, all the entries are paragraphs from a story about Знайка and the лунатики. The first paragraph (21:1.1.1.p18) mentions Знайка but only in a narrative, not in a dialogue. The second paragraph (22:1.1.1.p19) has Знайка again, but it's still a narrative where he reflects on his findings. The third paragraph (23:1.1.1.p20) continues the narrative about the лунатики's situation. \\n\\nWait, the task is about a dialogue between two named characters. The story here is in third person, describing Знайка's thoughts and the лунатики's history. There's no direct dialogue between two characters. The only named character is Знайка, and the лунатики are mentioned as a group. No two named characters are having a conversation here. \\n\\nSo, based on the provided batch, there's no dialogue between two named characters. The answer should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the evidence isn't present in the current batch. The user might need to check subsequent batches, but according to the given data, there's nothing to report.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1287,\"completion_tokens\":329,\"total_tokens\":1616}}\n",
