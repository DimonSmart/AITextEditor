The user wants to find a paragraph that describes the lunar crater visualization as an enormous circular field with an earth embankment along the edge. The context mentions looking for the terms 'визуализация лунного кратера', 'огромного круглого поля' and 'земляной вал по краю'. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, but the user is asking for another. The maxEvidenceCount is 2, so if we find another, the decision would be \\\"done\\\".\\n\\nLooking at each paragraph:\\n\\n- The first paragraph (12:1.1.1.p9) talks about the Moon's surface being molten and bubbles forming, but doesn't mention the specific terms.\\n- The next paragraphs (13-15) discuss volcanoes and meteorites, not the required terms.\\n- Paragraph 16 mentions volcanic craters but not the exact phrases.\\n- Paragraph 17 talks about volcanoes and meteorites again.\\n- Paragraph 18 discusses meteorite impacts, but again, not the specific terms.\\n- Paragraph 19 mentions a wall made of bricks, but not the exact terms.\\n- Paragraph 20 talks about the Moon's atmosphere and structures, but not the exact terms.\\n- Paragraph 21 describes the crater as a wall made of bricks, but not the exact terms.\\n- Paragraph 22 mentions the Moon's atmosphere and structures, but not the exact terms.\\n- Paragraph 23 talks about the Moon's interior and inhabitants, but not the exact terms.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The user's context includes 'визуализация лунного кратера' (visualization of the lunar crater), 'огромного круглого поля' (enormous circular field), and 'земляной вал по краю' (earth embankment along the edge). \\n\\nLooking at paragraph 12:1.1.1.p9, there's a mention of \\\"кольца\\\" (rings) and \\\"кольцевые горы\\\" (ring mountains), but not the exact terms. The term 'земляной вал' isn't present here. \\n\\nWait, maybe the term 'земляной вал' is translated as 'earth embankment' but in the text, the Russian term might be different. Let me check the exact phrases. The user's context uses 'земляной вал по краю', which translates to 'earth embankment along the edge'. \\n\\nLooking through the paragraphs again, I don't see any mention of 'земляной вал' or 'огромного круглого поля' except in the first paragraph. Wait, the first paragraph mentions \\\"огромных пузырей\\\" (huge bubbles) and \\\"следы от лопнувших пузырей\\\" (traces from burst bubbles), but not the exact terms. \\n\\nHmm, maybe there's no paragraph that matches all three terms. The user's snapshot has one evidence pointer, and the current batch might not have another. Therefore, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\" or \\\"continue\\\". But the user wants to find the paragraph that describes the visualization as an enormous circular field with an earth embankment. \\n\\nWait, maybe the term 'огромного круглого поля' is in the first paragraph. Let me check again. The first paragraph says \\\"огромных пузырей\\\" (huge bubbles), which is different from 'огромного круглого поля' (enormous circular field). \\n\\nI think there's no paragraph in the current batch that contains all three required terms. Therefore, the answer would be \\\"not_found\\\" or \\\"continue\\\". But the user's task says to find the paragraph, so if none are found, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\". However, the snapshot already has one evidence, and the user might be looking for another. But in the current batch, there's no paragraph that matches all three terms. So the correct decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2357,\"completion_tokens\":863,\"total_tokens\":3220}}\n",
