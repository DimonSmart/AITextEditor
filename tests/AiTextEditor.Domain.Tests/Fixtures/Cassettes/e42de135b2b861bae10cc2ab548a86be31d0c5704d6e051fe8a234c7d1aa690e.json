The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided the first batch of data. \\n\\nLooking at the items in the batch, all three are headers. The third item has a markdown heading \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". The pointer here is \\\"3:1.1.1\\\". The type is a heading, but the markdown includes the professor's name. Since the task says to exclude headers, but this is a heading that mentions the professor, I need to check if the heading counts. The instruction says \\\"исключая заголовки\\\", which means excluding headers. So headers are to be excluded. However, the heading here is part of the content, maybe a section title. But the user might consider headers as part of the structure, not the actual text. Wait, the task says \\\"в тексте (исключая заголовки)\\\", so the actual text content, not the headers. But in this batch, the only items are headers. So there's no text content here. Therefore, the first mention isn't found in this batch. The decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there might be more batches. But the user's snapshot shows that afterPointer is 3:1.1.1, which is the last item. Since the first batch is true and has more, but the current batch only has headers, maybe the first mention is in the next batch. But according to the given data, the current batch doesn't have any text content. So the evidenceCount is 0, and the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches to process. However, the user's snapshot says \\\"firstBatch\\\":true, \\\"lastBatch\\\":false, so there are more batches. Therefore, the correct decision is \\\"continue\\\" and no evidence found here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":519,\"completion_tokens\":409,\"total_tokens\":928}}\n",
