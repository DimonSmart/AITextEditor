The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdochkin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided the first batch of items. Looking at the items, there's only one paragraph with pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". The markdown content there talks about everyone being happy, Ponchik being the one who suffered, his confusion about the new clothes, and the mess his room became. \\n\\nI need to check if there's any mention of Professor Zvezdochkin here. The paragraph mentions Ponchik, the shop, clothes, and his room, but no professor. Since the task is to find the first occurrence, and this is the first batch, but the user says hasMore is true, meaning there are more batches coming. However, the current batch doesn't have any mention. The decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because we need to check subsequent batches. Also, the evidence array is empty here. So the correct JSON would have decision \\\"continue\\\" and no newEvidence. Wait, but the user's example in the schema shows that if nothing is found, it's \\\"not_found\\\" only when lastBatch is true and no evidence. But here, since hasMore is true, we can't decide yet. So the answer is decision \\\"continue\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":701,\"completion_tokens\":286,\"total_tokens\":987}}\n",
