Let me break down how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor that can scan through the document. The initial cursor created was for paragraphs with dialogue markers involving Znayka and the Professor. But the first run didn't find anything. Since the answer might be in a later batch, I should run the agent again with the same cursor. \\n\\nWait, the user mentioned \\\"якобы приходилось болтаться в центре Луны\\\" which translates to \\\"as if he had to hang around in the center of the Moon.\\\" So I need to look for a dialogue where Znayka uses a sarcastic remark about the professor's situation involving the Moon's center. \\n\\nMaybe the initial filter was too narrow. Let me adjust the filter to include more contexts, like any dialogue involving Znayka and the Professor, not just specific mentions. Also, considering that the professor's name might be mentioned in adjacent paragraphs, the cursor should capture all relevant dialogues. \\n\\nI should run the agent again with the same cursor to check the next batch. If it's not found there, perhaps expand the filter to include all paragraphs with dialogue markers involving the Professor, then check again. Also, ensure that the cursor isn't limited by maxElements and maxBytes to cover more text. \\n\\nWait, the first cursor had maxElements set to 500. Maybe increasing that or removing the limit could help. But the user's previous attempt used 500. Alternatively, maybe the dialogue is in a different section, so starting after a specific pointer might be necessary. However, without knowing the exact location, it's safer to continue scanning with the existing cursor. \\n\\nSo the next step is to call run_agent again with the same cursor to check the next portion. If it's still not found, perhaps create a new cursor with a broader filter, like all paragraphs containing the professor's name or Znayka's dialogue, and scan again. But since the user wants to avoid missing any mentions, ensuring the cursor captures all possible dialogues is crucial. \\n\\nAlso, checking if the initial filterDescription was too specific. Changing it to \\\"All paragraphs with dialogue markers involving Znayka or Professor\\\" might capture more instances. However, the user's first attempt used a specific filter. Maybe the answer is in a later batch, so continuing with the same cursor is the way to go. \\n\\nIn summary, the next action is to run the agent again with the existing cursor to check subsequent batches. If not found, adjust the cursor's filter and try again.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_335w37a7\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1445,\"completion_tokens\":612,\"total_tokens\":2057}}\n",
