The user is asking where in the book the professor Zvezdokhin is first mentioned, excluding headers. The first response used a cursor to find the first mention, but the evidence found was a heading. The user wants the actual text mention, not the heading.\\n\\nSo, the initial cursor created a filter for text including 'профессор Звёздочкин' and set maxEvidenceCount to 1. The agent ran and found the heading as evidence. But the user wants the first occurrence in the text, not the heading. \\n\\nNow, the assistant created another cursor starting after the pointer 3:1.1.1, which was the heading. The next run might get the actual text mention. But wait, the user wants the first mention in the text, so maybe the heading is considered part of the text? Or maybe the heading is metadata, and the actual mention is in the following paragraphs.\\n\\nThe user specified to exclude headers, so the answer should be in the text body. The first cursor found the heading, but the user wants the text. So the next step is to check the text after the heading. The assistant created a new cursor starting after the heading's pointer. When the agent runs again, it should find the first text mention. But the user might need to check if there's a mention in the text before the heading. Wait, the initial cursor might have included the heading as the first occurrence. Since the user wants the text, not the heading, the assistant needs to look for the first text mention after the heading. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the heading is the first mention, but the user wants the text. So the assistant should continue searching beyond the heading. The next tool call starts after the heading's pointer, so the agent will check the next portions. If there's a mention in the text, it will be found. If not, the answer is that the first mention is in the heading, but the user wants the text, so it's not found. But according to the previous response, the status says more items are available, so there might be another mention in the text. The assistant should run the agent again with the new cursor to find the text mention.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_ax4199ow\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first text mention of 'профессор Звёздочкин' after the heading\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1332,\"completion_tokens\":511,\"total_tokens\":1843}}\n",
