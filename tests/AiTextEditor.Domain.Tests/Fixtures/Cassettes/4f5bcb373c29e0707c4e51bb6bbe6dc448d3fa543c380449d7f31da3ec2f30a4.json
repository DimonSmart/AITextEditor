The user wants to find a mention of Znayka being on the Moon for about four hours and returning due to air problems. The context is a lunar expedition study.\\n\\nFirst, I need to scan the current batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, but the user is asking for more. Let me check each paragraph.\\n\\nLooking at the pointers, the first few paragraphs talk about losing weight and floating, which seems related to microgravity but not the time or air issues. Then there's a part where Znayka mentions the water in the bottle and the moon rock. But none of these mention the duration or air problems.\\n\\nWait, the task is about returning because of air problems. Let me check each paragraph again. The 69th paragraph mentions Znayka bringing a moon rock, but no time or air issues. The 70th paragraph has the professor talking about not discussing the book, which isn't relevant. \\n\\nHmm, maybe I missed something. Let me go through each item again. The 58th paragraph is about losing weight and floating, but that's about the experience in space, not the time or air. The 61st paragraph mentions Znayka's body losing weight, but again, no time or air issues. \\n\\nWait, the task is about being on the Moon for four hours and returning due to air problems. The current batch doesn't have any mention of time spent or air issues. The existing evidence from the snapshot was about a different part (pointer 8:1.1.1.p5, which isn't in the current batch). So in the current batch, there's no evidence that matches the task. Therefore, the decision should be 'not_found' since there's no new evidence here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2239,\"completion_tokens\":389,\"total_tokens\":2628}}\n",
