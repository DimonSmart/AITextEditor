The user wants to find the first mentions of \\\"Фуксия\\\" and \\\"Селедочка\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to see if either of these words appear.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", the markdown text is about Ponchik and his clothes. I'll check for the keywords. Scanning through the paragraph, I don't see \\\"Фуксия\\\" or \\\"Селедочка\\\" here. The second item is pointer \\\"7:1.1.1.p4\\\", which continues the story about Ponchik's clothes and the moth problem. Again, I'll search for the keywords. Still, no mention of either name. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me go through each paragraph again. The first paragraph mentions various characters like Пончик, Огурцовой реке, but no Фуксия or Селедочка. The second paragraph talks about the moth and the smell, but again, no trace of the names. \\n\\nSince neither of the keywords are present in the provided batch items, there's no evidence to report. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and the recentEvidencePointers are empty. The task is to find the first mentions, but since they aren't in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The user might need to check subsequent batches or confirm if the keywords are present elsewhere.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1283,\"completion_tokens\":331,\"total_tokens\":1614}}\n",
