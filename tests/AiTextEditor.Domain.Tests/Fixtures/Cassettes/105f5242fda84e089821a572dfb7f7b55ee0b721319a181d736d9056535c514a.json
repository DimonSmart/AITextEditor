The goal is to find the first mention of a lunar crater described as 'огромного круглого поля с земляным валом по краю'. The context is all paragraphs mentioning lunar craters or their features. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find just one instance.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look through the provided batch items. The first item has a pointer 4:1.1.1.p1, which is a paragraph about the Flower City and its changes. The second item is pointer 5:1.1.1.p2, another paragraph about the construction projects. \\n\\nI need to check if either of these paragraphs mention a lunar crater with the specific description. Let me read through the markdown content. \\n\\nThe first paragraph talks about the city's changes, new buildings, and vehicles. There's no mention of a lunar crater here. The second paragraph discusses the construction of industrial facilities and clothing factories. Again, no reference to lunar features. \\n\\nSince neither paragraph contains the required description, there's no evidence to report. The decision should be 'not_found' because the task's criteria aren't met in the current batch. Also, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and since there are no new matches, we can't reach the maxEvidenceCount of 1. Therefore, the output should indicate that no evidence was found in this batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1278,\"completion_tokens\":308,\"total_tokens\":1586}}\n",
