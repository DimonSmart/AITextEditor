The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions that all paragraphs with dialogue markers like quotes or dashes should be considered. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once we find one, we can stop.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, there are three paragraphs. Let's check each one for dialogue markers. \\n\\nThe first paragraph (18:1.1.1.p15) is a statement without any quotes or dashes. It's just a narrative about lunar craters. No dialogue here.\\n\\nThe second paragraph (19:1.1.1.p16) starts with \\\"На это Знайка отвечал...\\\" which translates to \\\"Znayka answered...\\\" The use of \\\"отвечал\\\" (answered) suggests a response, but there's no direct dialogue. It's more of a narrative explaining Znayka's argument. No quotes or dashes indicating spoken words between characters.\\n\\nThe third paragraph (20:1.1.1.p17) has \\\"Однако вулканисты и метеоритчики... презрительно называли его блинистом. Они говорили...\\\" Here, \\\"Они говорили\\\" means \\\"They said,\\\" which is a narrative of what they said, but again, no direct dialogue between named characters. The characters mentioned are \\\"вулканисты\\\" (volcanologists) and \\\"метеоритчики\\\" (meteoritists), but there's no direct exchange between them. \\n\\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The task says \\\"dialogue between two named characters.\\\" The user mentioned that dialogue markers like quotes or dashes are indicators. In the second paragraph, there's a dash after \\\"Знайка отвечал,\\\" but that's part of the narrative, not a dialogue. The third paragraph has \\\"Они говорили,\\\" which is a narrative of their speech, not actual dialogue. \\n\\nSo none of the paragraphs have direct dialogue between two named characters. The only named character mentioned is Знайка (Znayka), but the others are groups. Therefore, there's no dialogue between two named characters in the current batch. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since no evidence meets the criteria.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":896,\"completion_tokens\":491,\"total_tokens\":1387}}\n",
