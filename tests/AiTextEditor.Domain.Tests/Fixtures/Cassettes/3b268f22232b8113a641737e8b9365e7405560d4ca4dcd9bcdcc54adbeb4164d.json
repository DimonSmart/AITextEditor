The user wants the first dialogue between two named characters. I've tried creating different cursors with varying filters, but each time the agent returns \\\"not_found\\\" even though there are more items. Maybe the issue is that the filters aren't catching the dialogue markers correctly. Let me check the cursor parameters again.\\n\\nWait, maybe the problem is that the dialogue isn't marked with quotes or dashes. Perhaps it's using a different indicator, like ellipses or just a line break. The previous cursors used \\\"direct speech markers\\\" but maybe the actual dialogue in the document uses a different format. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the characters are mentioned in the same paragraph without direct speech, but the user is considering that as dialogue. No, the user specified \\\"direct speech,\\\" so it has to be actual dialogue.\\n\\nI should try a broader filter. Let's create a cursor that includes all paragraphs, not just those with markers. Then, the agent can scan every paragraph, and I can manually check for dialogue. But the user wants the first occurrence, so maybe the cursor should be set to read the entire document without filtering. \\n\\nWait, the cursor-create_cursor function allows a filterDescription. If I set it to \\\"All paragraphs,\\\" then the agent can process every paragraph. Then, in the agent's task, I can look for any direct speech between named characters. But the previous attempts with filters didn't find anything. Maybe the document doesn't have any dialogue marked with the usual indicators, or the characters aren't named properly. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the first dialogue is in a paragraph that wasn't processed yet. Since the agent is returning \\\"More items available,\\\" I need to keep running the agent until it finds the evidence. Let me try increasing the maxElements to ensure the cursor reads more paragraphs. \\n\\nWait, the user might have a document where dialogue is described without direct speech, like \\\"He told her about...\\\" but that's not direct dialogue. The user specified \\\"direct speech,\\\" so that's not it. \\n\\nI think the best approach is to create a cursor with \\\"All paragraphs\\\" filter, then run the agent again, allowing it to process more elements. If the agent still can't find it, maybe the document doesn't have such dialogue, and the answer is not found. But the user is asking for it, so I should keep trying. Let me adjust the cursor parameters again and run the agent once more.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_17isqvpp\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"All paragraphs\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":16777216,\\\"maxElements\\\":10000,\\\"name\\\":\\\"full_text_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1964,\"completion_tokens\":549,\"total_tokens\":2513}}\n",
