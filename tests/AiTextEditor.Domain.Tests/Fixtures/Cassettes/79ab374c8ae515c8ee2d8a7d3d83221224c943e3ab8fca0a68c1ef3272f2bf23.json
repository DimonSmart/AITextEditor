Since we have forward cursor, we might need to continue getting previous? The document cursor maybe sequential forward from start, so line 47 earlier than 49, we may have missed earlier items. The current chunk includes lines 49\u002B, so line 47 should have been just before. Need to request more items (continue) to get earlier lines.
