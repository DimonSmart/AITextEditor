Likely need to run cursor_agent to extract character info. But earlier attempts failed. Maybe need to use cursor_create_filtered_cursor with filterDescription to find paragraphs containing character names. But we already used keyword cursor. But dossiers update didn't produce entries. Maybe need to run cursor_agent after creating cursor. But we did. It returned no evidence. Maybe the tool expects to run cursor_agent with taskDescription and it will produce evidence. But we didn't get evidence. Maybe need to use cursor_agent with maxEvidenceCount? But still no evidence. Perhaps the cursor didn't include headings? We set includeHeadings true. But maybe need to set includeHeadings false? But headings are not needed. The cursor returned items but update didn't produce dossiers. Maybe the system expects to parse the cursor items and create dossiers automatically. But we didn't see any. Maybe we need to manually upsert dossiers? But the instruction: \\\"Создай каталог досье персонажей книги. Используй инструменты character_dossiers.generate_character_dossiers и character_dossiers.get_character_dossiers. Верни только JSON каталога.\\\" So we should just call generate_character_dossiers and get_character_dossiers. But we did, but got empty characters. Maybe the document hasn't been scanned yet. We need to run a full scan cursor and update dossiers. We did that earlier but still empty. Maybe need to run cursor_agent after full scan. We did but no evidence. Maybe the system requires to run cursor_agent with a specific taskDescription like \\\"Extract character information\\\". We did. But still no evidence. Maybe the cursor didn't include any paragraphs? But we saw items earlier. But update didn't produce dossiers. Maybe the system expects to run cursor_agent on the cursor after reading all items. But we didn't read items. We just ran agent. But maybe need to read items first. Let's read the cursor batch again. It returned empty. That means the cursor had no items? But earlier we saw items when reading kwd_cursor_2. But after update, maybe cursor was exhausted? We need to read again. Let's read again.\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_jcymviea\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"kwd_cursor_2\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":10330,\"completion_tokens\":460,\"total_tokens\":10790}}\n",
