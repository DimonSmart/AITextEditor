The user asked for the last mention of \\\"Фуксии\\\" (Fuchsia, probably a character's name). I created a cursor to find all paragraphs containing \\\"Фуксии\\\" and ran the agent to find all mentions. The first response gave an excerpt where Фуксии is mentioned as a young scientist preparing a second flight to the Moon. But the user wants the last occurrence, so I need to check if there are more items in the document.\\n\\nThe status says \\\"More items available,\\\" which means there might be other mentions later in the document. The cursor hasn't finished scanning. So I should call the agent again with the same cursor to get the next batch of evidence. Each time I run the agent, it processes the next portion of the document. I need to keep doing this until the cursor completes or until I find the last mention. Since the first result wasn't the last one, I have to continue searching. Let me make another tool call to run the agent again.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_00xq5l32\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":10,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find all mentions of Фуксии\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1804,\"completion_tokens\":255,\"total_tokens\":2059}}\n",
