The user wants to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to check if the word appears.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (pointer 4:1.1.1.p1), the text talks about Nезнайка's trip to the Sun City and various developments in the Flower City. I don't see \\\"Фуксии\\\" here. The second paragraph (pointer 5:1.1.1.p2) mentions the construction projects and the clothing factory by engineer Клёпки. Again, no trace of \\\"Фуксии\\\".\\n\\nSince neither of the paragraphs contains the term \\\"Фуксии\\\", there are no new evidence points to add. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and since the current batch doesn't have any matches, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". I need to make sure not to include any pointers from the recentEvidencePointers list, but since there are none, it's straightforward. The output should be a JSON object with decision \\\"not_found\\\" and an empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1256,\"completion_tokens\":254,\"total_tokens\":1510}}\n",
