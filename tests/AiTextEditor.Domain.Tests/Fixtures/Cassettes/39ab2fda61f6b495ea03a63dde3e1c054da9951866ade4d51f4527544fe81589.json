The user is asking about a specific scene in a book where Znayka sarcastically teases Professor about having to hang around the center of the Moon. First, I need to figure out the right approach to find this information using the provided tools.\\n\\nThe user mentioned using a QA assistant for a markdown book, so the document is likely structured with sections and paragraphs. The goal is to locate the exact place where this happens. The tools available include creating keyword cursors and reading batches from cursors. \\n\\nSince the question is about a specific phrase, I should use the cursor-create_keyword_cursor function. The keywords here would be \\\"Знайка\\\", \\\"профессора\\\", \\\"болтаться\\\", \\\"центре Луны\\\". But maybe I should use lowercase stems to cover inflections. So, the keywords could be \\\"znayka\\\", \\\"professor\\\", \\\"boltat'sya\\\", \\\"centr luni\\\". Wait, the user might have specific terms in the text. Let me think: the exact phrase is \\\"приходилось болтаться в центре Луны\\\", so the keywords would be \\\"болтаться\\\", \\\"центре\\\", \\\"Луны\\\". Also, \\\"Знайка\\\" and \\\"профессора\\\" are names, so including those as keywords might help.\\n\\nI need to create a keyword cursor with these terms. Then, read batches from that cursor to find the relevant paragraph. The answer should mention the specific location in the book, like a chapter or section. Since the user wants the final answer in Russian, I'll make sure to present it correctly. Also, check if previous steps have already found the information, but since this is the first step, I'll proceed with creating the cursor.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_4lcphkha\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"includeHeadings\\\":true,\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"znayka\\\",\\\"professor\\\",\\\"boltat'sya\\\",\\\"centr\\\",\\\"luna\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1198,\"completion_tokens\":418,\"total_tokens\":1616}}\n",
