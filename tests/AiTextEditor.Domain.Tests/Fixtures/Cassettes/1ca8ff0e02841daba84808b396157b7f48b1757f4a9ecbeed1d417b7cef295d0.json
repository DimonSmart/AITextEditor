The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters in all paragraphs. The current batch has three items. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan each item's markdown content for any dialogue. The first item is a paragraph where someone says, \\\"Дорогие друзья, разрешите заседание...\\\" but it's a single speaker, not a dialogue between two characters. \\n\\nThe second item has a paragraph where Professor Zvezdochkin is speaking. He's talking about Znayka's book and makes a claim about the moon. But again, it's a monologue. There's no dialogue here between two characters.\\n\\nThe third item starts with Znayka standing up and speaking. He's addressing the audience, but there's no mention of another character responding. The dialogue here is just Znayka talking, not a conversation between two named characters.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The second paragraph mentions Professor Zvezdochkin and Znayka. But the dialogue is one-sided. The professor is speaking, and Znayka hasn't responded yet. The third paragraph starts with Znayka speaking, but there's no other character's response. So there's no actual dialogue between two named characters in the current batch. \\n\\nSince the snapshot has zero evidence and the task is to find the first occurrence, but there's no dialogue between two characters here, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". No new evidence to add.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1035,\"completion_tokens\":327,\"total_tokens\":1362}}\n",
