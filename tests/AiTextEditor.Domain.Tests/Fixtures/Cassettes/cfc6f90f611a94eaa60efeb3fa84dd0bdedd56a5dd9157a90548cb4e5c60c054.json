The user is asking where Professor Zvezdokhin first appears, specifically the part where he \\\"boiled with indignation,\\\" and a brief description of his character.\\n\\nFirst, I need to find the mention of Professor Zvezdokhin. Since the user mentioned he \\\"kiplied ot nегодования,\\\" which translates to \\\"boiled with indignation,\\\" I should look for that exact phrase. But maybe the keywords should be more general. The name \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" is key here. I'll use the cursor-create_keyword_cursor function with the keywords \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" and \\\"кипел\\\" to catch any mentions. Wait, the user wrote \\\"кипел от негодования,\\\" so maybe \\\"кипел\\\" is part of the keyword. But the function requires lowercase stems. So \\\"кипел\\\" and \\\"негодования\\\" might be better as stems. Alternatively, maybe just \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" and \\\"кипел\\\" to cover variations.\\n\\nWait, the user wants the first appearance where he is described as boiling with indignation. So the exact phrase might be important. But since the function uses OR for keywords, maybe using \\\"Звёздочкин\\\" and \\\"кипел\\\" would capture that. Let me create a keyword cursor with those terms. Then read the batches to find the relevant paragraph. Once found, check if it's the first mention and describe his character. Also, need to ensure that the cursor includes headings, so the user can find the exact location. Then, after reading the batches, extract the information and finalize the answer.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_8l5x9dsn\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"includeHeadings\\\":true,\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"зведокчин\\\",\\\"кипел\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1198,\"completion_tokens\":383,\"total_tokens\":1581}}\n",
