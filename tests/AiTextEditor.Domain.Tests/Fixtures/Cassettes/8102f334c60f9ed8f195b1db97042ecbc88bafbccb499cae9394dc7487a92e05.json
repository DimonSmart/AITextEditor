The user wants me to find the first mention of \\\u0022\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\\\u0022 and note when apples started to bloom. I\u0027m using the ZvezdokinCursor with FirstMatch mode. \\n\\nFirst, I need to request the next items using cursor_next. Once I get the items, I\u0027ll scan through them to find the first occurrence of \\\u0022\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\\\u0022. Once I find that, I should check the same item or subsequent ones for the mention of apples blooming. Since it\u0027s FirstMatch mode, once I find the first match for the professor, I need to make sure that the apple blooming moment is noted. If the apple blooming is in the same item as the professor\u0027s mention, great. If not, I\u0027ll have to look further. \\n\\nWait, but the user wants both events: the first mention of the professor and the moment apples began to bloom. So maybe I need to track both. But since it\u0027s FirstMatch, perhaps the first occurrence of the professor is the main target, and then check if the apple blooming is in the same or subsequent items. \\n\\nI should start by getting the next items. Let\u0027s send cursor_next and then process each item. For each item, check if it contains \\\u0022\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\\\u0022. The first item that does is the first match. Then, within that item or the following ones, look for \\\u0022apples began to bloom\\\u0022. If found, note the index. If not, continue. \\n\\nBut the user might want both events to be in the same item. Or maybe the apple blooming is a separate event. I need to make sure that once the professor is found, I check for the apple blooming in the same or subsequent items. \\n\\nSo the steps are: \\n1. Use cursor_next to get items.\\n2. For each item, check for \\\u0022\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\\\u0022.\\n3. Once found, check the same item for apple blooming. If not there, continue checking subsequent items.\\n4. Once both are found, return the summary with the indices.\\n\\nBut since the mode is FirstMatch, maybe the first occurrence of the professor is the main target, and the apple blooming is another condition. However, the user might want both events to be captured. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the apple blooming is part of the same item as the professor\u0027s mention. So once the professor is found, check that item for the apple blooming. If not, proceed. \\n\\nI need to structure the JSON response with the action, indices, firstItemIndex, and summary. So once the first mention is found, and the apple blooming is noted, the summary should mention both. \\n\\nLet me start by sending cursor_next to get the first set of items. Then process each one.\\n\u0022},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022stop\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:236,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:623,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:859}}\n",
