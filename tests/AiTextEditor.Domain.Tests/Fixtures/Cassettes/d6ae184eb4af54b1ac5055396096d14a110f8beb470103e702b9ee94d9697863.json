The task is to find the first mention of 'профессор Звёздочкин'. The user provided a snapshot with evidenceCount 1 and recentEvidencePointers including \\\"3:1.1.1\\\". But the current batch's items don't have that pointer. The firstBatch is false, so we're not at the start. The items in the batch are paragraphs 10:1.1.1.p7 and 11:1.1.1.p8. \\n\\nLooking at the markdown content of these items. The first paragraph talks about astronomers arguing about lunar craters, mentioning вулканисты and метеоритчики, but no Звёздочкин. The second paragraph mentions Знайка and Стекляшкин, but again, no Звёздочкин. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers had \\\"3:1.1.1\\\", which isn't in the current batch. So, maybe the previous batch had evidence, but in the current batch, there's no mention of профессор Звёздочкин. Therefore, the decision should be 'not_found' since the current batch doesn't have the required mention. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't need to check for that. The newEvidence array should be empty because there's no matching content here.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1109,\"completion_tokens\":305,\"total_tokens\":1414}}\n",
