The user wants the first mention of a clothing factory producing rubber bras and synthetic fur coats. The context is paragraphs mentioning 'одёжная фабрика' and listing products from rubber bras to synthetic fur coats. The snapshot shows one evidence pointer already, but the current batch items don't seem to have any relevant content. The paragraphs here are about the Moon's surface and volcanic theories, not related to clothing factories. So, there's no new evidence in this batch. The decision should be 'not_found' since none of the items match the task criteria.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1109,\"completion_tokens\":136,\"total_tokens\":1245}}\n",
