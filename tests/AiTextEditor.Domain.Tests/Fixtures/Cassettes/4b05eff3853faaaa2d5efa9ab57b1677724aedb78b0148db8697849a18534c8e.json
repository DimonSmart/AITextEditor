The user wants the first mention of a clothing factory producing rubber bras and synthetic fur coats. The context is paragraphs mentioning 'одёжная фабрика' and listing products from rubber bras to synthetic fur coats.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, the items are all headings. The first item is a main heading, then a subheading, and another subheading. None of these headings mention 'одёжная фабрика' or list any products. The task requires finding a mention of the factory and its products, but the current batch doesn't have any such content. Since there's no evidence here, the decision should be 'not_found'. Also, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and none of the pointers in the batch are in recentEvidencePointers. But since there's no matching content, we can't add new evidence. So the output is 'not_found' with empty newEvidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":676,\"completion_tokens\":209,\"total_tokens\":885}}\n",
