Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor that looks for the specific terms. The user mentioned \\\"визуализация лунного кратера\\\" (visualization of the lunar crater) and the description \\\"огромного круглого поля с земляным валом по краю\\\" (huge round field with an earth embankment along the edge). So the filter description should include both the term and the description.\\n\\nI called the cursor-create_cursor function with those filters. The response was \\\"search_cursor\\\", which means the cursor was created successfully. Now, I need to run the agent to find the first mention using this cursor. Since the user is asking for the first occurrence, I'll set maxEvidenceCount to 1 to stop after the first result. \\n\\nWait, but the user might want the exact paragraph where this description is found. So after creating the cursor, the next step is to run the agent with the cursor name and task description to find the first mention. The agent will process the document portions and return the evidence items. If the first item contains the description, I'll extract the pointer and the text to confirm. If not, I'll need to check subsequent items, but since maxEvidenceCount is 1, it should stop there. \\n\\nI should make sure that the filter in the cursor is correctly capturing both the term and the description. The filterDescription parameter in the cursor-create_cursor includes both elements, so the cursor should stream the document parts that match. Then, the agent-run_agent with maxEvidenceCount=1 will get the first matching paragraph. Once found, I'll present the answer in Russian, including the semantic pointer as instructed.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_4t4db2xa\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of 'визуализация лунного кратера' described as 'огромного круглого поля с земляным валом по краю'\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1168,\"completion_tokens\":461,\"total_tokens\":1629}}\n",
