The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions lines with dialogue markers or character names. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items. The first item is a paragraph without any dialogue markers. The second paragraph starts with \\\"На это Знайка отвечал...\\\" which indicates a response from Знайка. But there's no mention of another character's dialogue here. The third paragraph has \\\"Однако вулканисты и метеоритчики...\\\" but again, no direct dialogue between two named characters. \\n\\nWait, maybe the second paragraph has Знайка's response, but the other characters are mentioned as \\\"вулканисты и метеоритчики\\\" without dialogue markers. The third paragraph mentions them again but not in a dialogue. So there's no direct dialogue between two named characters in the provided items.
