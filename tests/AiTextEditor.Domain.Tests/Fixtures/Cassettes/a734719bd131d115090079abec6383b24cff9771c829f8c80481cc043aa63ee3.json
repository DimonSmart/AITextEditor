The user wants the first dialogue between two named characters. I tried creating a cursor for dialogue paragraphs, but the agent kept canceling. Maybe the initial filter wasn't specific enough or the document's structure is different.\\n\\nI should create a new cursor with a broader filter, maybe including more dialogue indicators. Let me adjust the filter description to cover various markers like quotes, dashes, or other symbols. Also, increasing the max elements to ensure more paragraphs are scanned. \\n\\nWait, the user mentioned \\\"two named characters,\\\" so the dialogue must have both names mentioned. The previous attempts might have missed because the filter wasn't checking for two names. Maybe the agent isn't processing the filter correctly. Let me try again with a clearer filter and check each paragraph for two named characters in dialogue. If the cursor is set up right, the agent should find the first instance. If not, maybe the document doesn't have such a dialogue, but the user says it's in the book. Hmm, perhaps the issue is with the agent's processing, so I'll need to run the cursor again and check the evidence items carefully.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_apwvmxqs\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"dialogue_cursor_v2\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first dialogue between two named characters\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1654,\"completion_tokens\":277,\"total_tokens\":1931}}\n",
