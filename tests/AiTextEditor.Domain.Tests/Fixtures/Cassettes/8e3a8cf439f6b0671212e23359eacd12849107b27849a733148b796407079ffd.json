The user wants the first mention of Fuchs in the given batch. The task says to find the first occurrence, so I need to check each item in the batch carefully.\\n\\nLooking at the snapshot, evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty. The batch has three items, all headings. The first item is a main heading, then a chapter heading, then a section heading. None of these headings mention Fuchs. The markdown content for each is in Russian, and since the task is about finding Fuchs, which is a name, I need to check if any of these headings contain that name. \\n\\nSince the user specified \\\"All paragraphs\\\" as context, but the items here are headings, not paragraphs. However, the instructions say to prefer Paragraph/ListItem content, but if there are no paragraphs, maybe headings are considered. But in this case, none of the headings have Fuchs. The user might have intended to include headings, but since the task says \\\"first mention,\\\" and there's no mention in any of the items, the decision would be not_found. Also, the batch doesn't have any items with markdown containing Fuchs. So the answer should be decision: not_found, with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":647,\"completion_tokens\":272,\"total_tokens\":919}}\n",
