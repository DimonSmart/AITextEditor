The user wants to find the first mention of a lunar crater described as 'огромного круглого поля с земляным валом по краю'. First, I need to check the current batch's items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so no previous matches. The task's context is all paragraphs mentioning lunar craters or their features, but looking at the provided items, they're about Ponchik and his clothes, not lunar craters. The paragraphs talk about a river, moths, and smells, but nothing related to lunar features. The query's description mentions a large round field with an earth embankment, which doesn't match any of the text here. Since there's no mention of lunar craters or related terms in the batch items, the decision should be 'not_found'. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 1, but since there's no relevant evidence, it's not met. So the output is 'not_found' with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1294,\"completion_tokens\":227,\"total_tokens\":1521}}\n",
