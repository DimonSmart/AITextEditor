The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with two character names followed by dialogue. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items. The first item has a paragraph where Знайка is mentioned along with Фуксией and Селёдочкой. But the text describes their activities and observations on the Moon, not a direct dialogue. There's no dialogue section here; it's more of a narrative.\\n\\nThe second item is another paragraph discussing the Moon's surface and craters. Again, this is explanatory text without any dialogue between characters. \\n\\nSince the task requires dialogue lines with two names, and neither of the provided paragraphs contains such a line, there's no evidence here. The user might have expected a dialogue section, but based on the given content, there's nothing that fits. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" as there's no matching evidence in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1313,\"completion_tokens\":228,\"total_tokens\":1541}}\n",
