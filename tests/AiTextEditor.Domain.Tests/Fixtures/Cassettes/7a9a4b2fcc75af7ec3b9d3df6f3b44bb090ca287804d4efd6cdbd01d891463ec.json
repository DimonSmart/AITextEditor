The user wants me to find all mentions of 'профессора Звёздочкина' in the current batch, excluding headers. The task says to look for content that includes this phrase and isn't a header. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check each item in the batch. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so no previous matches. The current batch has three items. \\n\\nLooking at the first item: pointer 1:1 is a Heading with the markdown \\\"# Часть I\\\". Since it's a heading, I should skip it as per the task's instruction to exclude headers.\\n\\nThe second item is pointer 2:1.1, another Heading with \\\"## Глава первая\\\". Again, it's a heading, so skip.\\n\\nThird item: pointer 3:1.1.1, a Heading with \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". Even though it's a heading, the markdown contains the exact phrase 'профессора Звёздочкина'. Wait, the task says to exclude headers, but this is a heading. However, the user might have intended to include mentions within headers? Wait, the context says \\\"Contains 'профессора Звёздочкина' and not a header\\\". So headers are excluded regardless. But this heading's markdown includes the phrase. But since it's a header, should I exclude it?\\n\\nWait, the task's context says \\\"not a header\\\", so even if a header contains the phrase, it's excluded. So this third item is a heading, so even though it has the phrase, it's a header and should be excluded. Therefore, none of the items in the current batch are non-header content containing the phrase. \\n\\nSo the newEvidence array would be empty. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The third item's markdown is \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". The phrase is part of the heading's text. But since it's a heading (itemType is Heading), it's excluded. Therefore, there are no valid matches in this batch. \\n\\nSo the decision would be \\\"continue\\\" because there's no new evidence. But wait, the user's task says to find all mentions, and if none are found, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\"? Wait, the output schema's decision can be \\\"continue\\\", \\\"done\\\", or \\\"not_found\\\". Since there are no matches, maybe \\\"not_found\\\"? But the rules say to report all matches found in the batch. Since none are found, newEvidence is empty. The decision would be \\\"continue\\\" because there's no evidence to add, but maybe \\\"not_found\\\" if the task requires finding at least one. However, the task's maxEvidenceCount is null, so it's not a stopping condition. So the correct decision here is \\\"continue\\\" with empty newEvidence. But wait, the third item is a heading, so even though it contains the phrase, it's excluded. Therefore, no matches. So the output should have decision \\\"continue\\\" and newEvidence as empty array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":672,\"completion_tokens\":676,\"total_tokens\":1348}}\n",
