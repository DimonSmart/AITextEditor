The user asked for the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin and then to rewrite the paragraph adding that the apple trees started to bloom at that moment.\\n\\nFirst, I created a cursor to find the first occurrence of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" using the cursor-create_cursor function. The agent-run_agent was called with maxEvidenceCount=1 to get the first mention. The response pointed to pointer 3:1.1.1, which is a heading. But the user wants the actual paragraph where he's mentioned, not just the heading.\\n\\nSo next, I created another cursor, content_cursor, starting after pointer 3:1.1.1, to find the content following the heading. The agent-run_agent was called again to get the paragraph. The excerpt provided is the paragraph under the heading, mentioning Zvezdokhin's defeat by Znayka.\\n\\nNow, I need to check if this paragraph is the first mention. Since the heading was the first occurrence, the paragraph that follows is the first actual mention in the text. The user wants this paragraph rewritten with the addition about apple trees blooming.\\n\\nI should verify that the paragraph is indeed the first mention. The heading is a metadata entry, so the first paragraph under it is the first textual mention. The excerpt given is the correct one. Now, I need to add the part about apple trees. The user specified to add that \\\"в этот момент начали распускаться яблони\\\" (at that moment, the apple trees began to bloom). So inserting that sentence into the paragraph.\\n\\nWait, the original paragraph is: \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\" as the heading, and the content under it is the excerpt. The excerpt is the paragraph that mentions Zvezdokhin's defeat. So the first mention is in that paragraph. Now, adding the apple trees part. The user wants the rewritten paragraph with that addition. So the final answer should be the original paragraph plus the new sentence about the apple trees blooming.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_fctzsgcq\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"editor-create_targets\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"label\\\":\\\"Первое упоминание профессора Звёздочкина с добавлением о распускании яблонь\\\",\\\"pointers\\\":[\\\"3:1.1.1\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1335,\"completion_tokens\":494,\"total_tokens\":1829}}\n",
