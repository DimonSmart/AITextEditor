The user wants to find the first mention of Ponchik throwing old costumes into the Ogurcovna River. The context is all paragraphs mentioning Ponchik and the Ogurcovna River. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so no previous matches. The batch has two paragraphs.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (4:1.1.1.p1), it talks about Nезнайка's trip and changes in the city, but there's no mention of Ponchik or the river. The second paragraph (5:1.1.1.p2) discusses the clothing factory and machines, but again, no Ponchik or Ogurcovna River. \\n\\nSince neither paragraph mentions Ponchik or the river, there's no evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required mention isn't present in the current batch. No new evidence to add, so the newEvidence array remains empty.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1268,\"completion_tokens\":227,\"total_tokens\":1495}}\n",
