The user wants to know the first occurrence and a brief description of his character. Let me start by creating a cursor to search for mentions of him. I'll use the cursor-create_cursor function with a filter that looks for any paragraphs containing his name. Since the user mentioned he \\\"kiplied from indignation,\\\" I should also check for that phrase. But first, let's create the cursor with a broad filter to capture all mentions.\\n\\nWait, the cursor's filter needs to be stateless. So maybe the filter description should be something like \\\"All paragraphs mentioning 'профессор Звёздочкин' or 'кипел от негодования'\\\". That should cover the initial mentions. Then, I'll run the agent to scan the document using this cursor. The first evidence item found should be the first mention. I'll need to check the resulting paragraphs to see if they include both the name and the description. If not, I might need to adjust the filter or continue scanning.
