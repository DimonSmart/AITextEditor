First, I need to use the CursorAgentPlugin-run_cursor_agent function to find this information. The task is to locate the last occurrence of the term \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the text.\\n\\nSince the user wants the last mention, I should start the search from the end of the document. The function requires a taskDescription, which in this case is \\\"Find the last mention of Фуксии\\\". There's no previous context provided, so the context parameter can be left empty. The startAfterPointer is optional, but to start from the beginning, I might not need it. However, since the user wants the last mention, maybe the cursor should start from the end. But the function's parameters don't specify starting from a particular pointer, so perhaps the agent will handle that internally.\\n\\nI'll call the function with the taskDescription set to \\\"Find the last mention of Фуксии\\\". The function should return the relevant paragraph or list item where \\\"Фуксии\\\" is mentioned last. If the document doesn't have that information, the function will indicate it's not found. I need to make sure to return the answer in Russian and include the semantic pointer if applicable.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_fmn83anp\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"CursorAgentPlugin-run_cursor_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the last mention of Фуксии\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":353,\"completion_tokens\":299,\"total_tokens\":652}}\n",
