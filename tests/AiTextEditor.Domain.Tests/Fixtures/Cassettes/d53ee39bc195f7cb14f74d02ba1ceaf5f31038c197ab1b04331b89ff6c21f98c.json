The task is to find the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" (which I know is a character from a Russian children's book, maybe \\\"Ponchik\\\" or \\\"Punchik\\\"). The user provided a batch of text items, each with a pointer and markdown content. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, with pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", but since the current batch doesn't include that pointer, I need to focus on the current items.\\n\\nFirst, I'll go through each item in the batch. The pointers here start from 12:1.1.1.p9 up to 22:1.1.1.p19. The user's goal is to find the first occurrence of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the text. \\n\\nLooking at the markdown content of each item:\\n\\n1. The first paragraph (12:1.1.1.p9) talks about Знайка's theory about the Moon's surface, but no mention of Пончик here.\\n2. The next paragraphs (13-18) discuss the astronomers' reactions to Знайка's theories, but again, no Пончик.\\n3. Paragraph 19 (20:1.1.1.p17) mentions that the astronomers called Знайка a \\\"блинистом\\\" (which translates to \\\"pancake\\\" in a derogatory way), but that's not Пончик.\\n4. Paragraph 20 (21:1.1.1.p18) talks about Знайка's visit to the Moon and the brick wall, but no Пончик here.\\n5. The last paragraph (22:1.1.1.p19) mentions that Знайка published a book about the Moon's inhabitants, the \\\"лунные коротышки\\\" (lunar dwarfs), but again, no Пончик.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The task is to find the first mention of Пончик. The user's snapshot has a recent evidence pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", which isn't in the current batch. So the current batch's items are from 12 to 22. None of these paragraphs mention Пончик. \\n\\nBut wait, maybe there's a mention in the text that I overlooked. Let me scan each excerpt again. The first paragraph mentions Знайка's book, but not Пончик. The others discuss the theories and the brick wall. The last paragraph talks about the lunar inhabitants but not Пончик. \\n\\nHmm, maybe the answer is that there's no evidence in the current batch. But the user's task says to find the first mention. Since none of the current items mention Пончик, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\". However, the user's snapshot has evidenceCount 1, which might be from a previous batch. But the current batch doesn't have that pointer. So the newEvidence would be empty, leading to \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1979,\"completion_tokens\":661,\"total_tokens\":2640}}\n",
