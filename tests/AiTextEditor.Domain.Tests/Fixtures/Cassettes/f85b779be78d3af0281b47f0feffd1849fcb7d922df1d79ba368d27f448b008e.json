The user is asking where in the document it's mentioned that Znayka stayed on the Moon for about four hours and had to return urgently due to air issues. \\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out the right keywords to search for. The main elements here are \\\"Знайка\\\", \\\"Луна\\\" (Moon), \\\"четыре часа\\\" (four hours), and \\\"воздух\\\" (air). Since the user is looking for a specific mention, using these keywords should help locate the relevant section.\\n\\nI should use the cursor-create_keyword_cursor function with these keywords. The function allows searching for any of the keywords in the document. Lowercasing the stems might help catch variations, but since the user provided the exact terms, I'll use them as is. \\n\\nWait, the user mentioned \\\"воздух\\\" which translates to \\\"air,\\\" but maybe the document uses a different term like \\\"кислород\\\" (oxygen)? However, the user's question specifies \\\"воздух,\\\" so I'll stick with that. \\n\\nNext, after creating the cursor, I'll read the batches to find the exact paragraph. The answer might be in one of the paragraphs that include these keywords. I need to make sure to check all relevant sections, especially those discussing Znayka's lunar activities and any issues related to air. \\n\\nAlso, considering the step limit, I need to be efficient. If the first batch contains the info, I can stop there. If not, proceed to the next batches until the information is found or all possibilities are exhausted. \\n\\nI should also check if there's a mention of urgency or the need to return quickly, which ties into the \\\"срочно возвращаться\\\" part. Combining these elements in the search should narrow down the location. \\n\\nFinally, once the relevant paragraph is found, I'll note the pointer and confirm that it matches the user's query. If not, continue searching until the step limit is reached or the information is found.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_xiu5672v\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"includeHeadings\\\":true,\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"знайка\\\",\\\"луна\\\",\\\"четыре\\\",\\\"час\\\",\\\"воздух\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1189,\"completion_tokens\":469,\"total_tokens\":1658}}\n",
