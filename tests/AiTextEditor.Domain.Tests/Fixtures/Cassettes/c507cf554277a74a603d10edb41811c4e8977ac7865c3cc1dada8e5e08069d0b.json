Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to use the tools provided. The cursor-create_cursor function can help create a cursor to search through the document. The filterDescription should be something like \\\"mentions Ponchik\\\" to find relevant sections. Since they want the first mention, I'll set maxEvidenceCount to 1 to stop early. \\n\\nWait, but the user might be referring to a specific character from a story, maybe \\\"Ponchik\\\" is a character name. I should make sure the filter is correctly set to find any occurrence of that name. Using the cursor, I can scan the document in portions and stop at the first match. \\n\\nAlso, the agent-run_agent function will process the cursor's next portion. I need to run the agent with the cursor name and task description to find the first mention. The response should include the pointerLabel and the relevant paragraph. \\n\\nI should check if the book actually has this mention. If not, the answer would state it's not found. But assuming it's there, the first evidence item from the cursor should give the location. Let me structure the tool calls accordingly.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_paurhi05\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"contains the word 'Пончик'\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1053,\"completion_tokens\":298,\"total_tokens\":1351}}\n",
