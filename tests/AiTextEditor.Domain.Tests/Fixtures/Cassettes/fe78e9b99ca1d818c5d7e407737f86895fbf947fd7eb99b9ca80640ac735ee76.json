The user is asking for the second mention of Professor Zvёzdotkin in the book, excluding headers. \\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The user already used a keyword cursor with \\\"профессор\\\" and \\\"звёздочкин\\\" to find relevant sections. The response from the tool includes a heading and two paragraphs. The first mention is in the paragraph starting with \\\"Эта Знайкина книжка...\\\" where Professor Zvёzdotkin is mentioned. The second mention is in the next paragraph, \\\"Профессор Звёздочкин и предложил...\\\" which talks about him proposing a discussion. \\n\\nI need to check if there are more mentions beyond that. The tool response shows \\\"HasMore\\\": true, but the nextAfterPointer is at \\\"25:1.1.1.p22\\\", which is the end of the provided data. However, the user might need to continue searching. But based on the given data, the second mention is in the second paragraph. \\n\\nWait, the user wants the second occurrence, so the first is in the first paragraph, the second in the second. The answer should point to the second paragraph's semantic pointer. Also, the user might need the exact location, so including the semantic pointer makes sense. \\n\\nI should confirm that there are no other mentions in the provided data. Since the tool response only includes up to p22, and the nextAfterPointer is at p22, maybe there's more, but based on the given info, the second mention is in the second paragraph. So the answer is the second paragraph's semantic pointer.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1499,\"completion_tokens\":436,\"total_tokens\":1935}}\n",
