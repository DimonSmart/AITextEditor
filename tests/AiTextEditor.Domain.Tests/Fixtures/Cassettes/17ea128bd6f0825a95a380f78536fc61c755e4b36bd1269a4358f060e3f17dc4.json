The user wants the first dialogue between two named characters. I tried creating a cursor for dialogue lines before, but the first run didn't find anything, and the second attempt threw an error. Now, I've created a new cursor called dialogue_cursor_v2 with a slightly different filter: lines containing character names followed by dialogue markers.\\n\\nI need to run the agent again with this new cursor. The task is to find the first occurrence where two named characters are involved in a dialogue. Since the previous attempts didn't yield results, maybe the filter needs to be more precise. The new filter looks for character names followed by dialogue markers, which should capture direct speech. \\n\\nI'll call the agent-run_agent function with the new cursor name and a maxEvidenceCount of 1 to get the first match. If this works, it should return the correct dialogue line with both character names. If not, I might need to adjust the filter further, but let's try this first.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_evniahk7\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"dialogue_cursor_v2\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Найдите первый диалог между двумя названными персонажами\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1655,\"completion_tokens\":259,\"total_tokens\":1914}}\n",
