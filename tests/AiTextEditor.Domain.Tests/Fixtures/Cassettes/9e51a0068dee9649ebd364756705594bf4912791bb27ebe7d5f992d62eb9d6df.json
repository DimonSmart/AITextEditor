The user wants me to find the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the given batch. The task says to look for all paragraphs containing 'Пончик' and the maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once I find one, I should set the decision to \\\"done\\\".\\n\\nLooking at the snapshot, the evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty. That means no evidence has been found yet. Now, checking the current batch items. The first item is a heading with \\\"# Часть I\\\". The second is another heading \\\"## Глава первая\\\", and the third is \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". All of these are headings, not paragraphs. The task mentions to prefer Paragraph/ListItem content and ignore headings unless the task asks for them. Since the context is paragraphs containing 'Пончик', and none of the items in this batch are paragraphs, there's no evidence here. \\n\\nSo, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because there are no paragraph items in the current batch that mention Пончик. Also, the user's instruction says to only use content from the current batch. Since none of the items here are paragraphs with the required mention, I can't add any new evidence. Therefore, the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence added.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":654,\"completion_tokens\":298,\"total_tokens\":952}}\n",
