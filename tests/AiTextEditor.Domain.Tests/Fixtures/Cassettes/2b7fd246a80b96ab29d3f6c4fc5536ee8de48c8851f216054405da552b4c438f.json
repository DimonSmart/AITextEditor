The user wants the first mention of 'профессор Звёздочкин' in the provided batch. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence, with the pointer \\\"3:1.1.1\\\". But the current batch's items don't include that pointer. The first batch is false, and there are more batches coming.\\n\\nLooking at the items in the current batch: pointers 15:1.1.1.p12, 16:1.1.1.p13, and 17:1.1.1.p14. None of these pointers match the recentEvidencePointers from the snapshot. The task is to find the first mention, so I need to check each item's markdown for the exact phrase.\\n\\nThe markdown content in the first item is about lunar craters and volcanoes, no mention of Звёздочкин. The second item talks about volcanoes again, still no match. The third item starts with \\\"Метеоритчики говорили:\\\", which also doesn't include the name. \\n\\nSince none of the current batch items contain 'профессор Звёздочкин', the decision should be 'not_found'. The newEvidence array will be empty because there are no matches in this batch. The user might need to check subsequent batches since the first mention could be in a later one.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":809,\"completion_tokens\":307,\"total_tokens\":1116}}\n",
