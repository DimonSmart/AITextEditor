The user wants to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan each item's markdown content carefully. The task says to look for paragraphs containing 'Фуксии', but looking through the given items, none of the markdown texts include that term. The paragraphs discuss topics like weightlessness, a bottle of water, and comparisons to planets, but there's no mention of Фуксии. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include a pointer that's not in the current batch's items, so I shouldn't consider that. Since none of the current batch's items have the required term, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 10, but since there are no matches, the decision remains \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":993,\"completion_tokens\":186,\"total_tokens\":1179}}\n",
