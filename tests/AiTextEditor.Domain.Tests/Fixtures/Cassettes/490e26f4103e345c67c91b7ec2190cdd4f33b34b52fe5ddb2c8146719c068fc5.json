The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the current batch. The task says to scan only the current batch's items and extract evidence relevant to the goal. The snapshot shows that there are already 2 pieces of evidence found in previous batches, and the recent pointers are 8:1.1.1.p5 and 70:1.1.1.p67. But I need to check the current batch's items.\\n\\nLooking at the items provided: there are three paragraphs. The first one is pointer 75:1.1.1.p72 with markdown \\\"– Долой!\\\" – that's just an exclamation, no mention of Фуксии. The second is 76:1.1.1.p73, which talks about two small guys dragging someone out, but again, no Фуксии. The third is 77:1.1.1.p74, where they mention going to the Moon and speaking on a tribune, but still no Фуксии. \\n\\nWait, none of these paragraphs have the word 'Фуксии' in them. The user's task is to find all mentions, but the current batch doesn't seem to have any. The snapshot's recent pointers are from previous batches, so I shouldn't consider those here. Since the current items don't contain the term, the newEvidence array should be empty. The decision would be 'continue' because there's no new evidence to add. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is null, so we don't need to stop here. Therefore, the output should have decision 'continue' and an empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":775,\"completion_tokens\":368,\"total_tokens\":1143}}\n",
