The user wants to find all mentions of 'профессора Звёздочкина' in the provided batch, excluding headers. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to check if the exact phrase appears in the markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer 21:1.1.1.p18, the markdown doesn't mention 'профессора Звёздочкина'. The text talks about Знайка and his observations on the Moon, but no professor is mentioned here.\\n\\nNext, the second item with pointer 22:1.1.1.p19. The markdown here discusses Знайка's book about lunar beings called лунатики. Again, there's no mention of профессора Звёздочкина. The focus is on the lunar creatures and their structures, not any professor.\\n\\nMoving to the third item with pointer 23:1.1.1.p20. The markdown continues the story about лунатики moving inside the Moon. Still, there's no reference to профессора Звёздочкина. The entire batch seems to be about Знайка's discoveries and the lunar beings, but the specific professor isn't mentioned anywhere.\\n\\nSince none of the items in the batch contain the exact phrase 'профессора Звёздочкина', the newEvidence array should be empty. The decision would be 'not_found' because the required mentions aren't present in the current batch. Also, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and since there are no new matches, the decision remains 'not_found'.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1302,\"completion_tokens\":359,\"total_tokens\":1661}}\n",
