The user is asking where Пончик is first mentioned in the book. I need to find the earliest occurrence of the name Пончик.\\n\\nFirst, I created a cursor named \\\"search_cursor\\\" with a filter to find any text containing 'Пончик'. Then, I used the agent to run the task, looking for the first mention. The first response from the agent gave an excerpt where Пончик is mentioned as the only one who suffered. But the user might be looking for the very first mention, maybe earlier in the text.\\n\\nHowever, the next runs of the agent didn't find any new evidence, and the status said the cursor is complete. That means there are no more items to check. But wait, maybe the initial excerpt was the first mention. The user might have thought there's an earlier mention, but according to the tool responses, that's the first occurrence found. So the answer should be that Пончик is first mentioned in the paragraph where he's described as the only one who suffered in the situation. I need to confirm if that's indeed the first mention or if there's an earlier one that the cursor missed. Since the cursor didn't find anything else, that must be the first mention.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1522,\"completion_tokens\":354,\"total_tokens\":1876}}\n",
