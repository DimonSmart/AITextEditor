The user wants to find the first dialog between two named characters. The context mentions lines with character names followed by dialogue markers. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, there are three paragraphs. The first one doesn't have any dialogue markers; it's just a statement. The second paragraph starts with \\\"На это Знайка отвечал...\\\" which translates to \\\"Znayka answered...\\\" So here, \\\"Знайка\\\" is a character, and the response is his answer. But there's no mention of another character's dialogue here. The third paragraph mentions \\\"Однако вулканисты и метеоритчики...\\\" which are groups, not individual characters. \\n\\nWait, maybe the second paragraph is a dialogue. The user mentioned that lines with character names followed by dialogue markers. The second paragraph starts with \\\"На это Знайка отвечал...\\\" which is Znayka's response. But where is the other character's dialogue? The first paragraph is a statement, not a dialogue. The third paragraph is a statement from the vulcanologists and meteoritists. \\n\\nHmm, maybe the second paragraph is the first dialogue because it's Znayka's answer. But the task says \\\"between two named characters.\\\" So there needs to be two characters. The second paragraph only has Znayka's dialogue. The third paragraph mentions \\\"вулканисты и метеоритчики\\\" as groups, not individual characters. \\n\\nWait, maybe the first paragraph is a statement, and the second is Znayka's response. But the user wants a dialog between two characters. If the second paragraph is Znayka's answer, but there's no other character's dialogue mentioned here. The third paragraph is a statement from the vulcanologists and meteoritists. So maybe the first dialogue is between Znandka and the vulcanologists? But the third paragraph is a statement, not a dialogue. \\n\\nWait, maybe the second paragraph is the first dialogue because it's Znayka's answer, and the first paragraph is a statement. But the task requires a dialog between two characters. If the second paragraph is Znayka's response, but there's no other character's dialogue here. So maybe there's no dialog between two characters in the provided batch. \\n\\nBut the user's task says to find the first dialog between two named characters. The second paragraph has Znayka's dialogue, but no other character. The third paragraph is a statement from the vulcanologists and meteoritists. So maybe there's no dialog between two characters here. Therefore, the answer would be \\\"not_found\\\". But the user's example might have a different structure. Wait, maybe the second paragraph is considered a dialogue because it's a response. But the task requires two characters. If the first paragraph is a statement, and the second is Znayka's answer, but there's no other character's dialogue. So maybe there's no evidence here. Hence, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":903,\"completion_tokens\":665,\"total_tokens\":1568}}\n",
