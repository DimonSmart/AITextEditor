The user wants me to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. The context is all paragraphs, so I need to check every item in the batch.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, the items are all headings. The first item is a main heading, then a chapter heading, and finally a section heading. None of these are paragraphs; they're all headings. The task mentions \\\"All paragraphs,\\\" but the current batch doesn't have any paragraph items. The headings might be part of the document structure, but since the user specified paragraphs, maybe the actual dialogue is in the next batches. However, the user said to only scan the current batch. Since there are no paragraph items here, there's no dialogue to extract. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, and recentEvidencePointers is empty. So, I should return \\\"not_found\\\" because there's no relevant evidence in this batch. Also, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" since there's more batches coming. Wait, the user's output schema requires \\\"decision\\\" to be continue, done, or not_found. Since there's no evidence here, \\\"not_found\\\" makes sense. But the scanning strategy says to report all matches, but if there are none, then \\\"not_found\\\" is correct. So the final answer is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":652,\"completion_tokens\":297,\"total_tokens\":949}}\n",
