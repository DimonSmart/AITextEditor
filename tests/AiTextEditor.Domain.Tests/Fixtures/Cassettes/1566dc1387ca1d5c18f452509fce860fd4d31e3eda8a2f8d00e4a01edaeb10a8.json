Let me figure out how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to use the tools provided. The plan is to create a keyword cursor with the relevant keywords and then read the batches to find the answer. Since the user is asking about the first mention, I should look for the word \\\"Фуксия\\\" (Fuchsia) in the document. \\n\\nI should use the cursor-create_keyword_cursor function with the keyword \\\"фуксия\\\" in lowercase to cover any inflected forms. The includeHeadings parameter should be set to true to include all sections. \\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, I'll read the batches using cursor-read_cursor_batch. Each batch will give me paragraphs that mention Fuchsia. I need to check each paragraph to find the first occurrence. \\n\\nI should also check if there's a default document ID needed, but the user didn't specify a document, so maybe the cursor will handle it. If not, I might need to get the default document ID first. But according to the tools, the cursor functions might not require it. \\n\\nWait, the user's question is in Russian, so the document is likely in Russian. The keywords should be in lowercase stems. \\\"Фуксия\\\" is the main keyword. I'll create the cursor with that. \\n\\nAfter creating the cursor, I'll read the batches. The first paragraph that contains \\\"фуксия\\\" will be the answer. I need to make sure to read each batch until I find it. \\n\\nIf the cursor returns multiple mentions, I have to check each one to find the earliest occurrence. The answer should be the first mention's location. \\n\\nI should also check previous evidence in case the answer was found in an earlier batch. But since this is the first step, I'll start from the beginning. \\n\\nSo, the steps are: create the keyword cursor with \\\"фуксия\\\", read the batches, and find the first mention. Then finalize the answer with the pointer and stop reason.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_891k1ond\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"includeHeadings\\\":true,\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"фуксия\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1114,\"completion_tokens\":453,\"total_tokens\":1567}}\n",
