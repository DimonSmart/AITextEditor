The user wants the first mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" in the text, excluding headings. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so we need to look through the current batch.\\n\\nLooking at the items, the first few are headings, so those are skipped. The next item is a paragraph (pointer 4:1.1.1.p1) which mentions \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" in the heading. Wait, no, the heading is \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\", but the task says to exclude headings. So the actual mention in the paragraph content? Let me check the paragraphs.\\n\\nPointer 3:1.1.1 is a heading, so that's excluded. The next paragraphs (4,5,6,7) are all paragraph items. Looking at pointer 4's markdown: it starts with \\\"С тех пор как Незнайка совершил путешествие...\\\" and mentions \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" in the heading. Wait, no, the heading is part of the item with pointer 3. The actual paragraph content (pointer 4) doesn't mention Звёздочкин. The next paragraphs (5,6,7) also don't mention him. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\\n\\nWait, the heading at pointer 3 is \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\", which is a heading, so excluded. The paragraphs after that don't mention him. So maybe there's no mention in the current batch? But the task says to find the first mention. Wait, maybe the heading is considered part of the content? No, the task says to exclude headings. So in the current batch, there's no mention of профессор Звёздочкин in the paragraph content. Therefore, the answer would be \\\"not_found\\\". But wait, the user's input might have more batches. However, the firstBatch is true and hasMoreBatches is true, so there might be more batches. But according to the current batch, there's no mention. So the decision is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1898,\"completion_tokens\":490,\"total_tokens\":2388}}\n",
