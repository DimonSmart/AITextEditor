The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions looking for direct speech with quotes, dashes, or other indicators. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once we find one, we can stop.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch, the items are all headings. The first item is a main heading, then a chapter heading, and finally a section heading. None of these headings contain any dialogue. They're all just titles. Since the task requires direct speech markers, and there's no such content in the current batch, there's no evidence to report. The snapshot's evidenceCount is 0, and the recentEvidencePointers are empty. Since there are no items with dialogue in this batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". We need to wait for the next batch where actual paragraphs might contain the required dialogue.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":661,\"completion_tokens\":195,\"total_tokens\":856}}\n",
