The user asked for the second mention of Professor Zvezdochin, excluding headers. The first time, I created a cursor and ran the agent to find the first mention. The response included three pointers, but the first one was the initial mention. Then, when trying to find the second mention, the cursor returned only one pointer, which was the same as the first. But the user wants the second occurrence.\\n\\nWait, maybe the first pointer was the first mention, and the second pointer in the list was the second mention. But when I ran the agent again for the second mention, the cursor might have only found the first one again. Or perhaps the pointers are not ordered correctly. Let me check the pointers again. The first response had pointers 24:1.1.1.p21, 70:1.1.1.p67, and 79:1.1.1.p76. The user wants the second mention, so maybe the second pointer (70:1.1.1.p67) is the second mention. But when I tried to run the agent again, the cursor might have only found that one, leading to the error. Maybe the cursor didn't have more entries, so the second mention is actually the second pointer in the initial list. But the user's second query to find the second mention didn't get a second pointer. Maybe the initial list had three pointers, but the second run only found one. So the correct answer is the second pointer in the first response, which is 70:1.1.1.p67. But the error occurred because the cursor didn't have more entries. So I should confirm that the second mention is at 70:1.1.1.p67. The user might have made a mistake in the cursor setup, so I need to ensure that the correct pointer is selected. Therefore, the answer should be the second pointer from the first response.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_dsr21gml\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-create_targets\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"label\\\":\\\"Второе упоминание профессора Звёздочкина\\\",\\\"pointers\\\":[\\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":5971,\"completion_tokens\":467,\"total_tokens\":6438}}\n",
