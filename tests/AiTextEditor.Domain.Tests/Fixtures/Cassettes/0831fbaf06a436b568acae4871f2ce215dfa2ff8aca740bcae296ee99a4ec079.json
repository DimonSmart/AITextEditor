The user wants the first dialogue between two named characters. I've tried several cursors with different filters, but each time it's not found. Maybe the issue is that the dialogue isn't in a single line or paragraph. Perhaps the characters are mentioned in adjacent paragraphs. The initial advice mentioned using a broader filter for multi-paragraph dialogues. Let me try creating a cursor that looks for paragraphs with two character names, even if they're split across paragraphs. Wait, I already tried that with dialogue_cursor_v5. Maybe the problem is that the filter isn't capturing the actual dialogue markers. Maybe I need to adjust the filter to look for dialogue indicators like dashes or quotes. Let me try a new cursor that specifically checks for paragraphs containing two character names followed by dialogue markers. If that doesn't work, maybe the document doesn't have such a dialogue, and I should inform the user.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_ser29aw1\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"Paragraphs containing two character names followed by dialogue markers\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"maxElements\\\":500,\\\"name\\\":\\\"dialogue_cursor_v6\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2129,\"completion_tokens\":245,\"total_tokens\":2374}}\n",
