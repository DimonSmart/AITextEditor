The goal is to find the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The context is paragraphs with dialogue markers mentioning Znayka and Professor. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. There are two paragraphs here. Let me check each one carefully.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (pointer 8:1.1.1.p5), it talks about Znayka's trip to the Sun City and his activities on the Moon. There's a mention of a crater in the Moon's Sea of Clarity and a cave in the center of the crater. However, I don't see any direct dialogue from Znayka here. The text describes his actions but doesn't include a sarcastic comment from him about the professor.\\n\\nNow, the second paragraph (pointer 9:1.1.1.p6) discusses Znayka's return to the Flower City and his stories. It mentions astronomer Steklyashkin observing the Moon's surface. There's no mention of the professor here, so this paragraph doesn't seem relevant.\\n\\nWait, the task specifies that the evidence must be from the current batch. The snapshot has zero evidence, so I need to check if there's any mention in the current batch. The first paragraph mentions Znayka and the Moon's crater, but no dialogue. The second paragraph doesn't mention the professor. \\n\\nHmm, maybe I missed something. Let me re-read the first paragraph. The part about the cave in the center of the crater might be relevant. But the text says they explored a crater, stayed in a cave in the center, and observed gravity changes. There's no mention of the professor being stuck there. \\n\\nWait, the task is about Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center. The current batch doesn't have any dialogue from Znayka where he comments on the professor. The first paragraph's last sentence mentions that they had to leave because of air supply, but that's about their own situation, not the professor. \\n\\nSo, there's no evidence in the current batch that matches the task. The answer should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the required mention isn't present here. The user might have more batches, but based on the current input, there's nothing to report.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1320,\"completion_tokens\":508,\"total_tokens\":1828}}\n",
