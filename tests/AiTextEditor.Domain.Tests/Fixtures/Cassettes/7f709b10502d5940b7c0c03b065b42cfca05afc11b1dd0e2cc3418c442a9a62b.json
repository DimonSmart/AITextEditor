The user wants to find the first mention of Ponchik throwing old costumes into the Ogurcovna River. The context is all paragraphs mentioning both Ponchik and the Ogurcovna River. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check the current batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence with pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch has three items with pointers 21:1.1.1.p18, 22:1.1.1.p19, and 23:1.1.1.p20. \\n\\nLooking at each item's markdown content:\\n\\n1. The first paragraph (21:1.1.1.p18) talks about Znayka and lunar craters, but there's no mention of Ponchik or the Ogurcovna River here. \\n\\n2. The second paragraph (22:1.1.1.p19) discusses Znayka's book about lunar inhabitants, again no Ponchik or river mentioned.\\n\\n3. The third paragraph (23:1.1.1.p20) continues the lunar story, explaining how the lunar inhabitants moved inside the moon. Still, no Ponchik or Ogurcovna River here.\\n\\nNone of the current batch items mention Ponchik or the Ogurcovna River. The previous evidence pointer was from a different batch, and the current batch doesn't have any relevant content. Therefore, there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the required mention isn't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1306,\"completion_tokens\":368,\"total_tokens\":1674}}\n",
