The user asked for the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin and wants the paragraph rewritten with the addition that the apple trees started to bloom at that moment.\\n\\nFirst, I need to find the first occurrence of \\\"профессора Звёздочкина\\\" in the document. The cursor was created with a filter for that term, and the agent ran, returning a pointer 3:1.1.1 with the heading \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". \\n\\nBut the user wants the actual paragraph, not just the heading. The heading is metadata, so I need to check the subsequent paragraphs under that heading. However, the initial search might have stopped at the heading. To get the full paragraph, I should create a cursor that includes the heading and the following text. \\n\\nWait, the first evidence item is the heading. The actual paragraph might be the next item. So I should create a new cursor to read the document starting after pointer 3:1.1.1, filtering for the paragraph that follows the heading. Then, run the agent again to get the full paragraph. Once I have that, I can add the sentence about the apple trees blooming. \\n\\nBut the user wants the paragraph rewritten, so I need to ensure that the added sentence is integrated naturally. Let me check if the original paragraph is available. If the first mention is the heading, maybe the actual text starts after that. So, I'll create a cursor starting after the heading's pointer, filter for the next paragraph, and retrieve it. Then, append the apple trees detail.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_m3klp6u3\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"After pointer 3:1.1.1 and contains 'профессора Звёздочкина'\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"name\\\":\\\"content_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1266,\"completion_tokens\":394,\"total_tokens\":1660}}\n",
