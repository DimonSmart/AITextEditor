The user wants to find the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the provided batch. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence, and the recent pointer is \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". But since the current batch doesn't include that pointer, I need to check the items in the current batch.\\n\\nLooking at the items, the first item has a pointer \\\"24:1.1.1.p21\\\" and the markdown mentions \\\"Знайкина книжка\\\" but no \\\"Пончик\\\". The second item, \\\"25:1.1.1.p22\\\", talks about the professor discussing the book but again no mention of Пончик. The third item, \\\"26:1.1.1.p23\\\", starts with the professor's words but still doesn't have Пончик. \\n\\nWait, none of these paragraphs mention Пончик. The snapshot's recent pointer was from a previous batch, which isn't part of the current items. Since the current batch doesn't have any mention of Пончик, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the user's task is to find the first mention, but since the current batch doesn't contain it, there's no new evidence to add. So the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1128,\"completion_tokens\":302,\"total_tokens\":1430}}\n",
