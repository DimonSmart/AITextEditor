Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search for mentions of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". The function mcp-create_cursor is the right tool here. I'll set the name as \\\"search_cursor\\\" and the description to look for the professor's name. Since the user wants the first mention, I should start from the beginning of the document.\\n\\nNext, I'll use mcp-run_agent with the cursor name and a task description to find the first occurrence. The agent will iterate through the document. Once the first mention is found, I need to check if it's in the text or a header. If it's a header, I should continue searching. But the user specified to exclude headers, so the answer should be the first paragraph that mentions him.\\n\\nI should also remember to include the pointerLabel in the summary. If the first occurrence is in a paragraph, that's the answer. If not, keep running the agent until the correct section is found. Make sure not to include any headers in the response. If the document doesn't have the mention, inform the user it's not found.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_sjpebyfb\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"description\\\":\\\"Упоминания профессора Звёздочкина (исключая заголовки)\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":812,\"completion_tokens\":313,\"total_tokens\":1125}}\n",
