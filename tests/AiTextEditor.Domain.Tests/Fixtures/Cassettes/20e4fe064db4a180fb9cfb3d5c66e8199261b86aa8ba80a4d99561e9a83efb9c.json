Let me figure out how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to use the NavigationPlugin tools. The user wants to know the first mention, so I should probably start by creating a cursor to navigate through the book. The CreateCursor function allows setting parameters like direction, which should be forward to go from the start. The UseWholeBookCursor might be useful here to get the whole-book cursor, but since the user wants the first mention, starting from the beginning makes sense.\\n\\nWait, the QueryCursor function can execute an instruction over the cursor. Maybe I can use that to find the first occurrence. Let me think: if I create a cursor with forward direction, then use QueryCursor with an instruction to find mentions of \\\u0022\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\\\u0022, that might work. But how does the QueryCursor work? It applies the instruction to each portion and returns the LLM\u0027s decision. So the instruction should be something like \\\u0022Find the first mention of \u0027\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043E\u0440 \u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043E\u0447\u043A\u0438\u043D\u0027 and return the semantic pointer.\\\u0022\\n\\nAlternatively, using the MapCursor to process each portion and collect results, but that might be less efficient. Maybe the QueryCursor is better here because it can stop at the first occurrence. But I need to make sure the instruction is correctly phrased to get the first mention.\\n\\nSo the steps would be: create a cursor with forward direction, then use QueryCursor with the instruction to find the first mention. Then, once the pointer is obtained, use DescribePointer to get the details. Wait, but the user just wants the location in the book, like the chapter or section. The DescribePointer might give the exact position.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the GetNextPortion can be used to iterate through portions until the mention is found. But that\u0027s more manual. The QueryCursor is designed for such tasks. Let me structure the tool calls accordingly.\\n\\nFirst, create a cursor named \\\u0022profZvezdokhinCursor\\\u0022 with forward direction. Then use QueryCursor with that cursor and the instruction to find the first mention. Then, if the result is a pointer, use DescribePointer to get the location details. But the user might just want the chapter or section name, so the DescribePointer would decode the pointer\u0027s fields to get that info.\\n\u0022,\u0022tool_calls\u0022:[{\u0022id\u0022:\u0022call_sehei79z\u0022,\u0022index\u0022:0,\u0022type\u0022:\u0022function\u0022,\u0022function\u0022:{\u0022name\u0022:\u0022NavigationPlugin-CreateCursor\u0022,\u0022arguments\u0022:\u0022{\\\u0022cursorName\\\u0022:\\\u0022profZvezdokhinCursor\\\u0022,\\\u0022forward\\\u0022:true,\\\u0022includeText\\\u0022:true,\\\u0022maxBytes\\\u0022:2048,\\\u0022maxElements\\\u0022:20}\u0022}}]},\u0022finish_reason\u0022:\u0022tool_calls\u0022}],\u0022usage\u0022:{\u0022prompt_tokens\u0022:796,\u0022completion_tokens\u0022:545,\u0022total_tokens\u0022:1341}}\n",
