The user is asking for the third mention of Professor Zvezdochkin in the book, excluding headers. First, I need to figure out how to approach this.\\n\\nThe user mentioned using specific tools. The plan is to create a cursor with keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor, then read batches. But since they want the third occurrence, I need to make sure the cursor can track that. Wait, the cursor created by keyword_cursor might not track occurrences, but the initial plan uses a step-by-step approach with read batches. \\n\\nWait, the predefined goal's plan snapshot shows steps 0-3, with step 0 being creating a cursor. The user's query is in Russian, so I need to make sure the keywords are in lowercase stems. The keywords here would be \\\"профессор\\\" and \\\"звёздочкин\\\". But since the user wants the third mention, the cursor might not handle that directly. However, the initial plan uses multiple read batches to find the third occurrence. \\n\\nSo first, create a keyword cursor with \\\"профессор\\\" and \\\"звёздочкин\\\". Then read batches until the third mention is found. But the user's plan has step 0 as creating the cursor, then reading batches in steps 1 and 2. The final step is to finalize the answer. \\n\\nWait, the user's plan has a step limit of 128, but the example shows steps 0-3. The assistant needs to follow the steps as per the plan. So first, create the cursor with the keywords. Then read the first batch, then the second, and then check if the third mention is in the next batch. \\n\\nBut how to ensure that the third mention is captured. Each read batch might return a portion of the document. The assistant needs to process each batch, count the mentions, and find the third one. However, the cursor might not track the count, so the assistant has to manually count each occurrence as they read the batches. \\n\\nSo the first step is to create a keyword cursor for \\\"профессор\\\" and \\\"звёздочкин\\\". Then read the first batch, note the mentions, then read the next batch, and so on until the third mention is found. The answer would then be the pointer of the third occurrence. \\n\\nBut the user's plan has a stop reason of \\\"pending:no_more_batches\\\", which might mean that after reading the batches, the third mention is found. The final answer should include the semantic pointer of the third mention. \\n\\nSo the steps are: create the cursor, read batches, count each mention, and when the third is found, return its pointer. The assistant needs to make sure that the keywords are correctly stemmed and that the cursor is set up properly. Also, exclude headers, so the filter should not include any header-related terms. \\n\\nIn the end, the answer should be in Russian, mentioning the goal and the stop reason. The semantic pointer would be the pointer of the third mention found in the document.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_apib6lof\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"keyword_cursor-create_keyword_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"профессор\\\",\\\"звёздочкин\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1152,\"completion_tokens\":658,\"total_tokens\":1810}}\n",
