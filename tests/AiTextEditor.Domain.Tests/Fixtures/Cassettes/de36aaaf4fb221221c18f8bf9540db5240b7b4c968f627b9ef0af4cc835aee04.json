The user wants the first mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" in the text, excluding headings. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so we need to look through the current batch.\\n\\nLooking at the items provided, all the pointers are paragraphs. I'll go through each one's markdown content. The first paragraph (12:1.1.1.p9) talks about Знайка and the Moon's surface, but no mention of Звёздочкин. The next paragraphs discuss astronomers, volcanologists, meteoritologists, and Знайка's theories. None of these mention Звёздочкин. \\n\\nContinuing through the items: paragraph 21 mentions Знайка again, but still no Звёздочкин. Paragraph 22 talks about Знайка's book and the lunar inhabitants, but again, no Звёздочкин. The last paragraph (23:1.1.1.p20) is about the lunar inhabitants moving inside the Moon. \\n\\nWait, none of the paragraphs mention \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" at all. The task is to find the first mention, but in the current batch, there's no occurrence of that name. So the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since the evidence isn't present here. The user might have intended to include it in a later batch, but based on the provided data, it's not there. Therefore, the output should indicate that no new evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2183,\"completion_tokens\":348,\"total_tokens\":2531}}\n",
