The user wants me to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the provided batch. The task says to look for all paragraphs containing that term. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence, with the pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\". But the current batch has three items, none of which have \\\"Фуксии\\\" in their markdown. The first item is a paragraph with \\\"Верно! Правильно! Молодец, Знайка! Ура!\\\", which doesn't include the term. The second is \\\"Все захлопали в ладоши. Кто-то крикнул:\\\"—still no match. The third is \\\"– Долой Звёздочкина!\\\" which also doesn't have \\\"Фуксии\\\". \\n\\nSince none of the current batch items contain the required term, there are no new evidence points to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the task is to find mentions, and none are present here. Also, the user mentioned that if the maxEvidenceCount is reached, set decision to \\\"done\\\", but here we haven't even met the current count. So, the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":710,\"completion_tokens\":284,\"total_tokens\":994}}\n",
