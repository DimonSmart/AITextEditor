Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search through the document. The function cursor-create_cursor is the right tool here. The filterDescription should look for mentions of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". Since headers are to be excluded, I need to make sure the filter targets the text content, not the headings. \\n\\nWait, the cursor function's filterDescription is stateless and applies per element. So maybe the filter should check if the text contains the name and isn't a heading. But how to differentiate between headings and regular text? The tool might not have a built-in way to distinguish them unless the document's structure is known. However, the user specified to exclude headers, so perhaps the filter should look for the name in the text parts, not in the headings. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the cursor can be created with a filter that simply looks for the exact phrase \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" in the text. Since the user wants the first mention, the cursor will stream the document, and the agent will find the first occurrence. \\n\\nI should create the cursor with the filterDescription as \\\"Contains 'профессор Звёздочкин' in the text\\\". Then, run the agent to find the first mention. The agent will process each portion and return the first matching paragraph. \\n\\nI need to make sure that the cursor is created correctly and then run the agent. If the first match is found, return the paragraph and the pointer. If not, check if there are more portions. But since the user wants the first mention, stopping at the first occurrence is correct. \\n\\nAlso, the answer should include the semantic pointer. So after finding the paragraph, I'll need to use the editor-list_pointers or similar function to get the pointer label. Wait, the functions available include editor-list_pointers, which might list all pointers. But the user wants the pointerLabel from the first occurrence. \\n\\nAlternatively, when the agent finds the first mention, the evidence item will have the pointer. So the response should include that pointer. \\n\\nSo the steps are: create cursor, run agent, get the first evidence item, then return the paragraph and the pointer. If the cursor doesn't find it, then the answer is not found. \\n\\nI need to structure the tool calls accordingly. First, create the cursor with the correct filter, then run the agent to find the first mention. Then, check the result and return the appropriate answer with the pointer.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_lbp6ax31\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"Contains 'профессор Звёздочкин' in the text content (excluding headers)\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1002,\"completion_tokens\":602,\"total_tokens\":1604}}\n",
