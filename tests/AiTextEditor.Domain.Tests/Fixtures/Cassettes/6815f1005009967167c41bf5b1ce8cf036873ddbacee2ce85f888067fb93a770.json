The user wants me to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to check each item's markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item, pointer 60:1.1.1.p57, the markdown is \\\"Некоторые от нетерпения даже застучали по полу ногами.\\\" No mention of Фуксии here. \\n\\nNext, pointer 61:1.1.1.p58. The markdown talks about Знайка and some physical movements in a cabin, but nothing about Фуксии. \\n\\nThen, pointer 62:1.1.1.p59. The markdown is a question about whether the bottle had water or another drink. Still no Фуксии. \\n\\nNone of the items in the current batch contain the term \\\"Фуксии\\\". The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", which isn't in the current batch. Since there are no new matches, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 10, but since we haven't found any new evidence, it's not enough to set done. So the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with empty newEvidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1030,\"completion_tokens\":288,\"total_tokens\":1318}}\n",
