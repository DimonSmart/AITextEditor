The user wants the first mention of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\" with \\\"кипел от негодования\\\". But looking at the provided batch items, none of the paragraphs mention either of those terms. The first batch has three paragraphs discussing lunar craters and meteorites, with some playful language about \\\"блинистом\\\" (like a pancake), but no professor or boiling anger. Since the snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and there's no recent evidence pointers, I need to check if any of the current items have the required terms. Since they don't, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the user mentioned to use only the current batch, so no previous evidence is considered here. The output should be a JSON with decision as \\\"not_found\\\" and no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":922,\"completion_tokens\":189,\"total_tokens\":1111}}\n",
