Let me start by figuring out the best way to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to use the cursor-create_cursor function to set up a filter that looks for mentions of \\\"Фуксия\\\". Since the user wants the first mention, the filter should capture any occurrence of that name. The cursor will help scan the document in portions. \\n\\nI'll create a cursor with the name \\\"search_cursor\\\" and the filter description \\\"Contains 'Фуксия'\\\". This should find all paragraphs where the name appears. Then, I'll use agent-run_agent to process each portion until I find the first occurrence.\\n\\nWait, the agent might return \\\"Status: More items available\\\" if there's more text. So I need to keep calling run_agent with the same cursor name until I get the answer or the status indicates it's done. Also, I should check previous evidence in case the answer was found in an earlier batch.\\n\\nOnce I find the paragraph with the first mention, I'll note the semantic pointer if applicable and provide the answer in Russian. Let me make sure to use the correct functions and parameters as specified.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_357oioqn\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"Contains 'Фуксия'\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"maxElements\\\":1000,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":936,\"completion_tokens\":302,\"total_tokens\":1238}}\n",
