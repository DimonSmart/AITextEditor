The user wants the first mention of Znayka comparing the lunar surface to pancake and steam bubbles. The context is all paragraphs mentioning 'Знайка' and comparing the lunar surface to pancake or steam bubbles. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The snapshot shows that there are already 2 pieces of evidence, but the user is asking for the first mention. Wait, but the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include pointers from previous batches. However, the current batch's items start from pointer 24:1.1.1.p21 onwards.\\n\\nLooking at the first item in the batch (pointer 24:1.1.1.p21), the markdown mentions \\\"Знайкина книжка\\\" and talks about the book being criticized for not being scientifically grounded. However, there's no mention of the lunar surface, pancake, or steam bubbles here. \\n\\nNext, the second item (25:1.1.1.p22) discusses the professor organizing a discussion about the book. Still, no mention of the lunar surface or the specific comparisons. \\n\\nThe third item (26:1.1.1.p23) starts with the professor beginning his speech. Again, no relevant content here. \\n\\nSince none of the current batch items mention the lunar surface compared to pancake or steam bubbles, there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required mention isn't present in the current batch. The user might need to check subsequent batches if this information is in a later batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1163,\"completion_tokens\":352,\"total_tokens\":1515}}\n",
