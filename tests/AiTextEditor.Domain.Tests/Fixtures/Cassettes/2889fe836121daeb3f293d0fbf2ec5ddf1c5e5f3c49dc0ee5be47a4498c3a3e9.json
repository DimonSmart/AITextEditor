The task is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The goal mentions checking for paragraphs with speaker labels like 'Name: text', 'Name said, \\\"text\\\"', or dash-prefixed lines.\\n\\nLooking at the current batch items. The items provided are all headings. Let's check each one.\\n\\nFirst item: pointer \\\"1:1\\\", itemType Heading, markdown \\\"# Часть I\\\". That's a main heading, no dialogue here.\\n\\nSecond item: \\\"2:1.1\\\", Heading, \\\"## Глава первая\\\". Another heading, no dialogue.\\n\\nThird item: \\\"3:1.1.1\\\", Heading, \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". Still a heading. The title might hint at characters (Знайка and профессора Звёздочкина), but the markdown here is just the heading text. There's no actual dialogue in the heading itself. The task requires actual dialogue with speaker labels, like \\\"Name: text\\\" or similar. Headings don't have that structure.\\n\\nSo none of the current batch items contain any dialogue. The items are all headings, which are metadata or section titles, not the actual content with speaker labels. The task says to ignore headings unless explicitly asked, but the context here says to check for paragraphs with speaker labels. Headings aren't paragraphs with speaker labels.\\n\\nThe snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty. So no previous evidence. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, but since there's nothing in the current batch that matches, we can't find any evidence here.\\n\\nSo the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), and we need to check the next batch. But wait, the current batch has no evidence. So newEvidence should be empty. The decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches to process. The rules say if maxEvidenceCount is provided and we have enough, set done. But here, evidenceCount is 0, newEvidence is empty, so total is 0, which is less than maxEvidenceCount (1). So decision is continue.\\n\\nWait, the output schema requires newEvidence to be a list. Since there's no matching evidence in the current batch, newEvidence should be empty. Then decision is \\\"continue\\\" because there are more batches (hasMoreBatches is true). The task says to output exactly one JSON object.\\n\\nSo the JSON would have decision \\\"continue\\\", newEvidence as an empty array. Let me check the rules again. The rules say: Do NOT add evidence for a pointer that appears in snapshot.recentEvidencePointers. But here, recentEvidencePointers is empty, but none of the current items match, so newEvidence is empty.\\n\\nYes. So the output should be {\\\"decision\\\": \\\"continue\\\", \\\"newEvidence\\\": []}.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":688,\"completion_tokens\":613,\"total_tokens\":1301}}\n",
