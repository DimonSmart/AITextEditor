The user wants me to find the first mention of \\\"Фуксия\\\" in the given batch. The task says to look for the first occurrence, so I need to check each item in the batch carefully.\\n\\nLooking at the snapshot, the evidence count is 0, and there are no recent evidence pointers. The current batch has three items, all of which are headings. The first item is a heading with \\\"# Часть I\\\", the second is \\\"## Глава первая\\\", and the third is \\\"### Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\". \\n\\nI need to check if any of these headings contain \\\"Фуксия\\\". Let me go through each one. The first heading is \\\"Часть I\\\" – no. The second is \\\"Глава первая\\\" – still no. The third one is \\\"Как Знайка победил профессора Звёздочкина\\\" – that's a longer phrase. Wait, does that mention Фуксия? No, it's about Знайка and Звёздочкина. \\n\\nHmm, none of the headings have \\\"Фуксия\\\". The task says to use only the current batch's content. Since all items are headings and none contain the required term, there's no evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the first mention isn't present in this batch. Also, since the user mentioned \\\"first mention,\\\" but there's none, we can't proceed further. So the output should indicate that no evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":654,\"completion_tokens\":343,\"total_tokens\":997}}\n",
