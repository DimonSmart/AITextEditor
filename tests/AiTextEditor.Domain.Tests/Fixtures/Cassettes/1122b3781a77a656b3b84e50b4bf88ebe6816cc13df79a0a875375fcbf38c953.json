I need to find where this description is in the document.\\n\\nFirst, I created a cursor named \\\"lunar_crater_cursor\\\" with a filter for paragraphs mentioning lunar craters or their features. The tool response shows that the cursor was created successfully, and the first batch of results is ready. \\n\\nNow, I should use the agent to run through this cursor and look for the specific description. The task is to find the mention of the crater as a \\\"огромного круглого поля с земляным валом по краю\\\". I'll set the task description to look for this exact phrase. \\n\\nI'll call the agent with the cursor name and the task description. If the agent finds the relevant paragraph, it will return the evidence item. If not, I'll need to continue scanning the next batches by calling the agent again with the same cursor. \\n\\nI need to make sure that the answer is in the text and not just the heading. The user wants the actual paragraph where this description is given. Also, if the first batch doesn't have it, I should keep checking subsequent batches. Let's start with the first batch.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_eml7g47y\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"lunar_crater_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of a lunar crater described as 'огромного круглого поля с земляным валом по краю'\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1365,\"completion_tokens\":335,\"total_tokens\":1700}}\n",
