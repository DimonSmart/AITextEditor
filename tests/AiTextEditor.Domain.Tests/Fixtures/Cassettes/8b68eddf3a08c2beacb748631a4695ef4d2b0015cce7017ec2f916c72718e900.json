The user wants me to find the first dialogue between two named characters and name them. So, first, I need to create a cursor to scan the document. I did that with cursor-create_cursor using filterDescription \\\"true\\\" to get all paragraphs.\\n\\nThen I ran agent-run_agent with the task to check for consecutive paragraphs starting with character names followed by a colon, different names. The first two runs didn't find anything, but status says more items available. So I need to keep running the agent until it finds something or completes.\\n\\nWait, maybe the problem is that the filterDescription is too broad? But the task description is supposed to handle checking for the dialogue structure. Let me think. The task says \\\"Check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different.\\\"\\n\\nBut maybe the document doesn't have colons. Maybe it's using other punctuation or formatting. Or maybe the names are not at the start of the paragraph. For example, sometimes dialogue might be in quotes without the name first. But the task description specifies \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon\\\", so maybe the document uses that format.\\n\\nBut the first two runs didn't find anything. So I need to keep running the agent again. Since the status is \\\"More items available\\\", I should call run_agent again with the same cursorName.\\n\\nWait, the user's previous steps: first cursor created, then two runs of agent-run_agent, each time no evidence found but more items available. So I need to continue calling run_agent until either it finds something or status is cursor_complete.\\n\\nSo next step is to run agent-run_agent again with the same parameters. Let's do that.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_67aa49ccd32749c88b9d7cbe\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different.
