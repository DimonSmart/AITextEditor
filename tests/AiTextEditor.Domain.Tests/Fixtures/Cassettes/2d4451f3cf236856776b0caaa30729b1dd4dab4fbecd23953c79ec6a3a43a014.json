The user is asking to find a paragraph that describes two rotating buildings on Kolokolchikov Street with a spiral descent and a devil's wheel on the roof. The context mentions the keywords 'Колокольчиков', 'вертящихся зданий', 'спиральный спуск', and 'чёртовым колесом'. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check the current batch items. The snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence, but the user is looking for more. The batch has two items: pointers 6:1.1.1.p3 and 7:1.1.1.p4. \\n\\nLooking at the first item (6:1.1.1.p3), the markdown talks about Ponchik and his clothes, but there's no mention of buildings, Kolokolchikov Street, or the required elements. The second item (7:1.1.1.p4) also discusses Ponchik's clothes and the moth problem, again no relevant terms.\\n\\nSince none of the current batch items contain the keywords related to the task, there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be 'not_found' because the required information isn't present here. The user might need to check subsequent batches, but based on the provided data, there's nothing matching the criteria.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1331,\"completion_tokens\":302,\"total_tokens\":1633}}\n",
