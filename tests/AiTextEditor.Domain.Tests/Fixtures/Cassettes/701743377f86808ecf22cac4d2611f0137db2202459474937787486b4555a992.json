The user wants the first mention of Professor Zvezdokin being described as \\\"кипевший от негодования\\\" and a brief character description. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check the current batch's items. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0, so no previous matches. The task is to find the first occurrence, so I have to scan each item carefully.\\n\\nLooking at the paragraphs provided, none of them mention Professor Zvezdokin. The characters present are Znayka, Fuxiya, Selyodka, Steklyashkin, etc. There's no reference to Zvezdokin here. The user might be referring to a different batch, but since the current batch doesn't have any mentions, the answer would be that there's no evidence found. \\n\\nSince the task requires the first occurrence and the current batch doesn't have it, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there might be more batches. But according to the rules, if there's no evidence in the current batch and evidenceCount is 0, but there are more batches, the decision remains \\\"continue\\\". So the correct output is \\\"continue\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":2124,\"completion_tokens\":260,\"total_tokens\":2384}}\n",
