The user is asking in which paragraph Znayka compares the lunar surface to a well-baked pancake and explains the steam bubbles. First, I need to create a cursor to search for this specific mention. The filter description should be about Znayka's comparison and the steam bubbles. I'll use the cursor-create_cursor function with the filterDescription including those keywords. The maxEvidenceCount is set to 1 to get the first occurrence.\\n\\nAfter creating the cursor, the next step is to run the agent to find the evidence. Using agent-run_agent with the cursor name and task description that matches the user's query. The task description should look for the comparison and explanation of steam bubbles. \\n\\nOnce the agent runs, if it finds the relevant paragraph, I'll check the evidence item. If the pointerLabel is present, I'll include it in the answer. If not, I'll state that it's not found. Since the user wants the answer in Russian, I'll make sure to translate the response accordingly. Also, I need to ensure that the semantic pointer is included if applicable. If the cursor returns the correct paragraph, I'll summarize it and provide the answer with the pointer label.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_8batpbe8\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"maxEvidenceCount\\\":1,\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the paragraph where Znayka compares the lunar surface to a well-baked pancake and explains steam bubbles\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1211,\"completion_tokens\":313,\"total_tokens\":1524}}\n",
