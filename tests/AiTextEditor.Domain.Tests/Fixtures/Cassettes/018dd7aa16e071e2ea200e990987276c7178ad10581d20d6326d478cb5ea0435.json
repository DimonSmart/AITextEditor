The user wants the first mention of \\\"Fuchs\\\" in all paragraphs. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence, with the pointer \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\". But the current batch's items are pointers 10 and 11. The user's goal is to find the first mention, so I need to check these new items.\\n\\nLooking at the first item's markdown: it talks about lunar craters, volcanoes, meteorites, and astronomers. No mention of Fuchs here. The second item's markdown mentions Znayka, Steklyashkin, and their observations about lunar craters. Still, no Fuchs. \\n\\nSince neither of these paragraphs mention Fuchs, there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the current batch doesn't have the first mention. Also, the user's snapshot already has evidence from a previous batch, but the current batch's items don't contribute anything. So the answer is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1093,\"completion_tokens\":238,\"total_tokens\":1331}}\n",
