I created a cursor to search for the term 'Пончик' in the document. The first run of the agent didn't find any evidence, but the cursor status says there are more items available. So I need to call the agent again with the same cursor to check the next portion of the document. Let me make sure to use the same cursor name and task description. Maybe the mention is in a later paragraph that wasn't included in the first batch. I'll run the agent again to continue scanning.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_1625bnqo\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of Пончик\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1387,\"completion_tokens\":155,\"total_tokens\":1542}}\n",
