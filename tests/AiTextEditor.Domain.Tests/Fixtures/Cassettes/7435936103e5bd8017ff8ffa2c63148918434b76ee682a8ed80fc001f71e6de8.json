The task is to find a paragraph where Ponchik chooses a darker night and drowns his old costumes in the Ogurcovna River. The user provided a snapshot with evidenceCount 1 and recentEvidencePointers including \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". But the current batch's items start from pointer \\\"74:1.1.1.p71\\\" onwards. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check each item in the current batch. The pointers in the batch are from 74 to 86. The recentEvidencePointers from the snapshot include \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\", which isn't in the current batch, so maybe that's from a previous batch. Since the user said to only use the current batch, I should ignore the snapshot's recent pointers for this batch.\\n\\nLooking through the markdown content of each item:\\n\\n- The paragraphs from 74 to 82 discuss Zvezdokhinn's dismissal and the meeting closing. None mention Ponchik or the Ogurcovna River.\\n- The heading \\\"Глава вторая\\\" (Chapter Two) and the subheading \\\"Загадка лунного камня\\\" (The Mystery of the Lunar Stone) are there, but not relevant.\\n- The paragraph starting at 85:1.2.1.p1 talks about the newspaper report and the lunar inhabitants, but again, no mention of Ponchik or the river.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. The task mentions Ponchik choosing a darker night and drowning old costumes in the Ogurcovna River. The current batch's items don't have any mention of Ponchik or the river. All the pointers in this batch are about Zvezdokhinn and the newspaper articles. \\n\\nSince there's no evidence in the current batch that matches the task, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". The newEvidence array would be empty. Also, the snapshot's evidenceCount is 1, but since we're only using the current batch, and there's no match here, the answer is \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1487,\"completion_tokens\":453,\"total_tokens\":1940}}\n",
