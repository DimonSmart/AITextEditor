Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search for mentions of \\\"профессор Звёздочкин\\\". The function mcp-create_cursor is the right tool here. I'll set the name as \\\"search_cursor\\\" and the description to look for the professor's name. Since the user wants the first mention, I should start from the beginning of the document.\\n\\nNext, I'll use mcp-run_agent with the cursor name and a task description to find the first occurrence. The agent will iterate through the document. Once it finds the first mention, the response should include the pointerLabel and the actual text. I need to make sure that the answer doesn't include any headers, so I'll check the paragraph content. If the cursor returns a result, I'll stop and provide that. If not, I'll continue searching until the end of the document. If no mention is found, I'll inform the user accordingly.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_b60utkeg\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"description\\\":\\\"Мentions of профессор Звёздочкин (исключая заголовки)\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":748,\"completion_tokens\":272,\"total_tokens\":1020}}\n",
