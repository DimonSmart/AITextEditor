The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters, using lines with dialogue markers or character names. The context is about lines with dialogue markers or character names, and the max evidence count is 1. \\n\\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided batch items. The first item is a paragraph with pointer 8:1.1.1.p5. It mentions Znayka meeting Fuxiya and Selodka, but there's no dialogue here. The paragraph talks about their activities on the Moon but doesn't include any direct dialogue between the characters.\\n\\nThe second item is pointer 9:1.1.1.p6. This paragraph discusses Znayka's return to the Flower City and his stories, especially mentioning astronomer Steklyashkin. However, there's no dialogue between two named characters here either. The text describes Steklyashkin's observations but doesn't include any conversation between characters.\\n\\nSince neither paragraph contains a dialogue between two named characters, there's no evidence to report. The task requires finding such a dialogue, but the current batch doesn't have it. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" as there's no relevant evidence in the current batch items.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1312,\"completion_tokens\":271,\"total_tokens\":1583}}\n",
