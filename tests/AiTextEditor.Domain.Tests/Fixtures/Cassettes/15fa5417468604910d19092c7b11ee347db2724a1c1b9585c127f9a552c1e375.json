The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 0 and recentEvidencePointers is empty, so we need to check the current batch.\\n\\nLooking at the items in the batch, all the pointers are paragraphs. The user mentioned that headers should be excluded, so I need to make sure none of the paragraphs are headers. The context is about mentions of профессор Звёздочкин, but scanning through the provided paragraphs, I don't see that name anywhere. All the mentions are about Знайка and discussions about the Moon's features, but not профессор Звёздочкин. \\n\\nSince none of the paragraphs in the current batch contain the required name, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". There's no new evidence to add here.
