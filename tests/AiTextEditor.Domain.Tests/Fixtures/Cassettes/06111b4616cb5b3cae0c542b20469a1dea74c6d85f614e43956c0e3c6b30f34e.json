The user wants to find the first mention of \\\"Пончик\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan through each item in the batch to check if \\\"Пончик\\\" appears in the markdown content.\\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer \\\"21:1.1.1.p18\\\", the markdown talks about Знайка and lunar craters, but I don't see \\\"Пончик\\\" here. The second item, \\\"22:1.1.1.p19\\\", mentions Знайка realizing the walls were made by intelligent beings and talks about the lunar inhabitants, but again, no \\\"Пончик\\\". The third item, \\\"23:1.1.1.p20\\\", discusses the lunar inhabitants moving inside the moon, still no mention of Пончик.\\n\\nWait, the snapshot shows that there's already one piece of evidence with pointer \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". But the user's current batch doesn't include that pointer. The task is to look only in the current batch. Since none of the items in the current batch mention \\\"Пончик\\\", there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the first mention isn't present here. Also, the user might be continuing from a previous batch where the evidence was found, but in this batch, there's nothing. So the output should indicate that no new evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1291,\"completion_tokens\":320,\"total_tokens\":1611}}\n",
