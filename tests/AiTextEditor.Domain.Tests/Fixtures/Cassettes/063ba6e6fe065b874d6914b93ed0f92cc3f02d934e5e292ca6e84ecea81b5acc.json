The user is asking about a specific description in the book: two rotating buildings on Kolokolchikov Street, with a spiral descent and a devil's wheel on the roof. First, I need to figure out how to locate this information using the provided tools.\\n\\nThe user mentioned \\\"улице Колокольчиков\\\" which translates to Kolokolchikov Street. So, I should start by creating a cursor to search for mentions of this street. The function cursor-create_cursor can be used here. The filterDescription should look for the street name. Let me set up the cursor with the name \\\"search_cursor\\\" and the filterDescription as \\\"mentions of Kolokolchikov Street\\\".\\n\\nOnce the cursor is created, I'll run the agent to find the first occurrence. The taskDescription would be to find the first mention of Kolokolchikov Street. Using agent-run_agent with the cursorName and maxEvidenceCount set to 1 to get the first instance. If the result includes the description of the two rotating buildings, great. If not, I might need to adjust the search.\\n\\nWait, the user specified two rotating buildings, a spiral descent, and a devil's wheel. These are specific elements. Maybe the initial search for the street will lead me to the relevant paragraph. If the first result doesn't have all the details, I might need to search for the specific elements. But since the user is asking for the location where all these are described, I should check if the initial search for the street includes those details.\\n\\nIf the first evidence item from the cursor doesn't mention all the required elements, I might need to create another cursor focusing on the specific features. Alternatively, check if the existing cursor's results can be parsed for those details. Since the tools don't allow for complex queries, I have to rely on the cursor's filter. Maybe the initial search for the street will include the buildings' description. Let's proceed step by step.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_zor79su0\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"mentions of 'Колокольчиков' and 'вертящихся зданий' and 'спиральный спуск' and 'чёртово колесо'\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1084,\"completion_tokens\":495,\"total_tokens\":1579}}\n",
