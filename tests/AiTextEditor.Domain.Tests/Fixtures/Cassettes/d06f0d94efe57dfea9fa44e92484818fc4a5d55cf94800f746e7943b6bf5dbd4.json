The task is to check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different. Then return the names and the dialogue text.\\n\\nFirst, I need to look at the current batch items. The batch has three paragraphs. Let's check each one.\\n\\nFirst item: pointer \\\"36:1.1.1.p33\\\", markdown starts with \\\"– Почему же не научно? – авторитетно ответил Знайка.\\\" Wait, the structure here is a dash, then dialogue, then \\\"ответил Знайка\\\". So the speaker is mentioned after the dialogue. The actual start of the paragraph is a dash, then the quote. So the name \\\"Знайка\\\" comes after the dialogue, not at the beginning followed by a colon.\\n\\nSecond item: pointer \\\"37:1.1.1.p34\\\", markdown starts with \\\"– Вот, вот! – подхватил Звёздочкин.\\\" Again, same structure: dash, dialogue, then \\\"подхватил Звёздочкин\\\". So the speaker's name is after the dialogue, not at the start followed by a colon.\\n\\nThird item: pointer \\\"38:1.1.1.p35\\\", markdown starts with \\\"Слушатели, которые пришли послушать доклад, засмеялись, но Знайка не смутился этим и сказал:\\\". This is a narrative sentence, not a dialogue starting with a name. It says \\\"Знайка не смутился... и сказал\\\", but the actual dialogue isn't here yet. The paragraph ends with \\\"сказал:\\\" but there's no quote following it in this item.\\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So the paragraph should start with something like \\\"Знайка: ...\\\" or \\\"Звёздочкин: ...\\\". But in the current batch, all the paragraphs start with a dash (which is probably a quotation dash), then the dialogue, then the speaker's name with a verb like \\\"ответил\\\" or \\\"подхватил\\\". So the speaker's name isn't at the beginning followed by a colon. Instead, the structure is \\\"– [dialogue] – [speaker] said...\\\".\\n\\nSo for example, the first paragraph starts with \\\"– Почему же не научно? – авторитетно ответил Знайка.\\\" So the actual start is a dash, then the quote, then another dash, then the speaker. So the name \\\"Знайка\\\" is part of the sentence after the dialogue, not at the beginning followed by a colon.\\n\\nSimilarly, the second paragraph starts with \\\"– Вот, вот! – подхватил Звёздочкин.\\\" Again, same structure. The third paragraph starts with \\\"Слушатели, которые пришли...\\\" which is a narrative, not a dialogue.\\n\\nSo none of these paragraphs start with a character's name followed by a colon. The task is looking for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a name and colon. But in the current batch, the structure is different. The names are mentioned after the dialogue, not at the beginning.\\n\\nTherefore, there are no matches here. So the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there's no evidence found in this batch, and there are more batches (hasMoreBatches is true). But wait, the output needs to check if any evidence is found. Since none of the items meet the criteria, newEvidence should be empty.\\n\\nWait, the rules say: \\\"Do NOT add evidence for a pointer that appears in snapshot.recentEvidencePointers.\\\" But in this case, recentEvidencePointers is empty, but the current batch items don't match the criteria. So newEvidence should be an empty list.\\n\\nDecision: if there's no new evidence, but there are more batches, then decision should be \\\"continue\\\". Because the task hasn't been completed yet (maxEvidenceCount is null, so no max), but we need to check if there's any evidence. Since none found, newEvidence is empty, so decision is \\\"continue\\\".\\n\\nWait, the decision options are \\\"continue\\\", \\\"done\\\", or \\\"not_found\\\". Wait, the rules say: \\\"If 'maxEvidenceCount' is provided in the task and you have found enough evidence (snapshot.evidenceCount + newEvidence.length \\u003e= maxEvidenceCount), set decision=\\\"done\\\".\\\"\\n\\nBut in this task, maxEvidenceCount is null. So even if we found some evidence, but since max is null, we don't stop until all batches are processed? Or maybe \\\"done\\\" is when there's no more evidence to find. But the decision \\\"not_found\\\" might be when there's no evidence in the current batch and no more batches. But the current batch has hasMoreBatches: true, so there are more batches. So if no evidence found here, decision is \\\"continue\\\".\\n\\nSo for this case, newEvidence is empty list. Decision is \\\"continue\\\".\\n\\nCheck the rules again: \\\"Do NOT add evidence for a pointer that appears in snapshot.recentEvidencePointers.\\\" But since recentEvidencePointers is empty, but the current items don't match the criteria, so no new evidence.\\n\\nSo output JSON: decision \\\"continue\\\", newEvidence empty array.\\n\\nYes. Because there's no evidence in this batch. So the agent should continue scanning next batches.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":861,\"completion_tokens\":1135,\"total_tokens\":1996}}\n",
