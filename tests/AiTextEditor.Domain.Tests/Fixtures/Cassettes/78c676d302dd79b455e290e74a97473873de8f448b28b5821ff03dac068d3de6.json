The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context is all paragraphs, and the maxEvidenceCount is null, so we need to find all instances but specifically the first one.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look through the provided batch items. The first item is paragraph 24:1.1.1.p21. It mentions Professor Zvezdochkin and his reaction to Znayka's book. But there's no dialogue here, just his opinion. \\n\\nNext is paragraph 25:1.1.1.p22. Here, Zvezdochkin proposes an academic discussion. Again, no direct dialogue between two characters. The mention of him suggesting the discussion is a monologue.\\n\\nThen paragraph 26:1.1.1.p23. This paragraph starts with the setup for the discussion. The key part here is when Zvezdochkin begins his speech. However, the user is looking for a dialogue between two named characters. The current paragraphs only mention Zvezdochkin's actions and proposals but don't have a direct conversation between two characters yet. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first batch has three items. None of them show a dialogue between two named characters. The professor is speaking, but there's no other character's response yet. The task is to find the first such dialogue. Since there's no dialogue in the provided batch, the decision would be \\\"not_found\\\". But wait, the user's snapshot has evidenceCount 0, and the batch items don't have any dialogues between two named characters. So the correct response is to indicate that no evidence was found in this batch. Therefore, the decision is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1115,\"completion_tokens\":380,\"total_tokens\":1495}}\n",
