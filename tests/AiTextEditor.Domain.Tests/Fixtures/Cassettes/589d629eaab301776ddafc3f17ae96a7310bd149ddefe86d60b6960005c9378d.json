The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context specifies that lines must have at least two named characters in a dialogue format. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items:\\n\\n1. The first item (27:1.1.1.p24) is a paragraph starting with \\\"– Дорогие друзья, разрешите заседание...\\\" It's a formal opening, no dialogue here.\\n\\n2. The second item (28:1.1.1.p25) has a paragraph where Professor Zvezdochkin is giving a lecture. He mentions Znayka's book and criticizes Znayka. However, this is a monologue by the professor, not a dialogue between two characters. There's no interaction here.\\n\\n3. The third item (29:1.1.1.p26) starts with \\\"Выслушав всё это, Знайка поднялся со своего места и сказал насмешливо:\\\" This is Znayka responding, but it's just him speaking after the professor's lecture. There's no mention of another character in dialogue here.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The professor is talking, then Znayka responds. But in the second paragraph, the professor is speaking, and Znayka is mentioned as the author of the book. However, the actual dialogue between two named characters isn't present here. The professor is talking about Znayka's book, but there's no direct dialogue between them. The third paragraph starts with Znayka speaking, but there's no other character mentioned in that line. \\n\\nHmm, maybe there's no dialogue between two named characters in this batch. The task says to find the first dialogue, but if none exists, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". However, the user might expect that the professor and Znayka are in a dialogue. Wait, the professor is talking about Znayka's book, but that's not a dialogue. The only dialogue is Znayka's response, but that's just him speaking after the professor's lecture. There's no back-and-forth between two characters. \\n\\nTherefore, there's no evidence of a dialogue between two named characters in the current batch. So the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\".\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1044,\"completion_tokens\":520,\"total_tokens\":1564}}\n",
