The user is asking about a specific moment in the book where Znayka sarcastically comments on the professor being stuck in the center of the Moon. First, I need to locate any dialogue between Znayka and the professor that mentions the Moon's center.\\n\\nI created a cursor to search for paragraphs with dialogue markers involving both characters. The first run of the agent didn't find any evidence, so I need to continue scanning. Maybe the dialogue is in a later part of the document. I'll run the agent again with the same cursor to check the next batch of paragraphs. If the answer isn't there, I might need to adjust the filter or check for alternative phrasings. But for now, let's keep searching with the existing cursor.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_xprih434\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of Znayka sarcastically commenting on the professor being stuck in the Moon's center\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1365,\"completion_tokens\":216,\"total_tokens\":1581}}\n",
