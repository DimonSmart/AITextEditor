The user is asking where in the document it's described how astronomers in the Solar City got into a fight and split into volcanologists and meteoritists. First, I need to figure out the right approach.\\n\\nSince the user is asking about a specific event—astronomers in Solar City splitting into two groups—I should use the cursor-create_cursor function to search for mentions of this event. The filterDescription should look for keywords like \\\"астрономы\\\", \\\"Солнечный город\\\", \\\"ссорились\\\", \\\"разделились\\\", \\\"вулканисты\\\", and \\\"метеоритчики\\\". \\n\\nI'll create a cursor named \\\"search_cursor\\\" with that filter. Then, using agent-run_agent, I'll scan the document with this cursor. The maxEvidenceCount can be set to 1 to find the first mention. If the first result doesn't contain all the details, I might need to adjust, but the user probably wants the first occurrence. \\n\\nWait, the user might be referring to a specific section where this split is discussed. The cursor will stream through the document, and the agent will check each portion. If the first evidence item includes all the keywords, that's the answer. If not, I'll need to continue scanning. But since the user asked for the location, the first mention is likely sufficient. \\n\\nI should also check if there are any headings that mention Solar City or the split, but the user specified to look in the text, not headings. So focusing on the cursor's evidence items is correct. Let's proceed with creating the cursor and running the agent.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_mstmsl7l\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"Contains 'астрономы', 'Солнечный город', 'ссорились', 'разделились', 'вулканисты', 'метеоритчики'\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1081,\"completion_tokens\":422,\"total_tokens\":1503}}\n",
