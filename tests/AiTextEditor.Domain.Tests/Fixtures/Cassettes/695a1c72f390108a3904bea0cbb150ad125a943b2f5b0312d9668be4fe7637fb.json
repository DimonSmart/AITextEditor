The user wants to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan each item's markdown content carefully. \\n\\nLooking at the first item, pointer 24:1.1.1.p21, the markdown talks about a book by Znayka and mentions Professor Zvezdochkin's reaction. But I don't see \\\"Фуксии\\\" here. The second item, 25:1.1.1.p22, discusses the academic discussion about the book. Still no mention. The third item, 26:1.1.1.p23, starts with the professor's speech. Again, nothing about Фуксии.\\n\\nWait, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers includes \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch items don't have any references to Фуксии. The task's context says to look for all paragraphs containing 'Фуксии', but none of the current items mention it. So, there's no new evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since there are no matches in the current batch. Also, the user's snapshot shows evidenceCount is 1, but since the current batch doesn't add any new evidence, the total remains 1. The output should reflect that no new evidence was found.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1131,\"completion_tokens\":311,\"total_tokens\":1442}}\n",
