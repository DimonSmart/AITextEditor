The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the current batch. The task says to scan only the current batch's items and extract relevant evidence. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check each item in the batch. The snapshot shows that there are already 2 pieces of evidence, but the recent pointers are different from the current batch. The current batch has three items: two paragraphs and a heading. \\n\\nLooking at the first item, pointer 81:1.1.1.p78, the markdown is \\\"– На этом заседание объявляю закрытым.\\\" No mention of Фуксии here. The second item, pointer 82:1.1.1.p79, says \\\"После чего встал и тоже пошёл домой.\\\" Still nothing. The third item is a heading, pointer 83:1.2, with \\\"## Глава вторая\\\". Also no Фуксии.\\n\\nSince none of the current batch items contain 'Фуксии', there's no new evidence to add. The decision should be 'continue' because there are no matches. The newEvidence array will be empty. I need to make sure not to include any pointers from the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers since the current batch doesn't have those. Also, the output must be a JSON object with exactly the specified fields. No extra text or code fences. Alright, that's all.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":699,\"completion_tokens\":324,\"total_tokens\":1023}}\n",
