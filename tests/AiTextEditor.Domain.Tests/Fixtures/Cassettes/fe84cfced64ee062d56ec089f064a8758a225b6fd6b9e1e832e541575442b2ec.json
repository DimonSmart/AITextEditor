The user is asking for the second mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the book, excluding headers. They want the location, so I need to use the cursor functions.\\n\\nFirst, I created a cursor named \\\"search_cursor\\\" to find mentions of Professor Zvezdokhin. Then, I ran the agent to find the first mention. The first result was at pointer 24:1.1.1.p21. \\n\\nNext, I ran the agent again to find the second mention. The response indicated \\\"cursor_complete\\\", which means there are no more results. But the user is asking for the second mention, so I need to check if there's another entry. \\n\\nLooking back at the tool responses, the first run gave three pointers, but the second run didn't find any more. Maybe the second mention is the one at pointer 79:1.1.1.p76? Wait, the first run's evidence included three pointers, but the second run's task was to find the second mention. However, the tool response after the second run said \\\"cursor_complete\\\", implying no more. \\n\\nWait, maybe the initial search_cursor found all mentions, and the second mention is the second entry in the NewEvidence array. The first mention was at 24:1.1.1.p21, then 70:1.1.1.p67, and 79:1.1.1.p76. So the second mention would be 70:1.1.1.p67. But the user wants the second occurrence, so maybe the second one is at 70:1.1.1.p67. However, the tool response after the second run said \\\"cursor_complete\\\", which might mean that the agent didn't find any more. \\n\\nWait, perhaps the first run's NewEvidence had three entries, but the second run's task was to find the second mention. The first run's NewEvidence had three pointers, but the second run's response was \\\"cursor_complete\\\", which might mean that the agent didn't find any more. This is confusing. Maybe the second mention is the second entry in the first run's NewEvidence, which is 70:1.1.1.p67. But the user is asking for the second mention, so I should check if that's the case. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the first mention is 24:1.1.1.p21, the second is 70:1.1.1.p67, and the third is 79:1.1.1.p76. But the user is asking for the second one, which would be 70:1.1.1.p67. However, the tool response after the second run said \\\"cursor_complete\\\", which might mean that the agent didn't find any more. So perhaps the second mention is the second entry in the first run's NewEvidence. \\n\\nI need to confirm. The user's question is about the second mention, so the answer should be the second pointer in the list. Therefore, the second mention is at 70:1.1.1.p67. But the tool response after the second run said \\\"cursor_complete\\\", which might indicate that there are no more. However, the initial search_cursor might have found all mentions. So the second mention is 70:1.1.1.p67. \\n\\nBut the user is asking for the second occurrence, so I should return that pointer. However, the tool response after the second run said \\\"cursor_complete\\\", which might mean that the agent didn't find any more. Therefore, the second mention is the second entry in the first run's NewEvidence, which is 70:1.1.1.p67. \\n\\nSo the answer should be the pointer 70:1.1.1.p67. But I need to make sure. The user is asking for the second mention, so the second one in the list. Therefore, the answer is 70:1.1.1.p67.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_70en2n2t\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"mcp-create_targets\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"label\\\":\\\"Второе упоминание профессора Звёздочкина\\\",\\\"pointers\\\":[\\\"70:1.1.1.p67\\\"]}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":5893,\"completion_tokens\":913,\"total_tokens\":6806}}\n",
