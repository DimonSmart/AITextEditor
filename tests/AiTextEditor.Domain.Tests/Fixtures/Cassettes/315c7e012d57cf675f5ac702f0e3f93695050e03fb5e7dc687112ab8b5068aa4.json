The user wants to find all mentions of \\\"Фуксии\\\" in the provided batch. First, I need to scan each item's markdown content carefully. \\n\\nLooking at the first item with pointer 21:1.1.1.p18, the markdown doesn't have \\\"Фуксии\\\". The second item, 22:1.1.1.p19, also doesn't mention it. The third item, 23:1.1.1.p20,同样 no mention. \\n\\nWait, the snapshot's recentEvidencePointers includes \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", but that's from a previous batch. The current batch items don't have any references to Фуксии. So, there's no new evidence here. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" since none of the current items contain the term. I need to make sure not to include any pointers from the snapshot's recent list. Therefore, the output is \\\"not_found\\\" with an empty newEvidence array.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1294,\"completion_tokens\":236,\"total_tokens\":1530}}\n",
