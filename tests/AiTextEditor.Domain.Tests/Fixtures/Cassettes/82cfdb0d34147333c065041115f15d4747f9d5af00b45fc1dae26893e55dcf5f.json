The user asked how the second chapter ends, and I need to answer in English.\\n\\nFirst, I called the RunCursorAgent tool with a task description to find the second chapter heading and the content until the next chapter, then return the last paragraph. The response from the tool says the second chapter ends with a cliffhanger about the hidden door. The evidence pointer is 5:2.p2, which probably refers to the second paragraph of chapter 2.\\n\\nThe summary from the tool's response clearly states that the last paragraph of the second chapter is about a cliffhanger involving a hidden door. So the answer should be that the second chapter ends with a cliffhanger about the hidden door.\\n\\nI need to make sure the answer is in English as per the user's request. The tool's response already gives the exact phrase, so I can just present that. No need to add anything else since the tool's evidence is clear. Just confirm the ending as described.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1081,\"completion_tokens\":219,\"total_tokens\":1300}}\n",
