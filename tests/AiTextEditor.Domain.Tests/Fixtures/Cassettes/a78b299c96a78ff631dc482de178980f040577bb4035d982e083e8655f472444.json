The user wants the first mention of Фуксия and Селедочка. But looking at the provided batch items, none of the paragraphs mention those names. The snapshot's recentEvidencePointers include \\\"8:1.1.1.p5\\\", which isn't in the current batch. The current batch has pointers 21:1.1.1.p18, 22:1.1.1.p19, and 23:1.1.1.p20. All the text here talks about Знайка, лунные кратеры, кирпичные стены, and лунатики. No Фуксия or Селедочка are present. Since the task is to find the first mention, but there's none in the current batch, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the evidenceCount is 1 from the snapshot, but since the current batch doesn't add any new evidence, the newEvidence array remains empty. So the output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1293,\"completion_tokens\":244,\"total_tokens\":1537}}\n",
