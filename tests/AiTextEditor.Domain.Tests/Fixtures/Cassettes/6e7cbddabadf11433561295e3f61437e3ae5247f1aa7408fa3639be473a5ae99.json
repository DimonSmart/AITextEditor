The user wants the first mention of Ponchik throwing old costumes into the Ogurcovna River. The context is all paragraphs mentioning both Ponchik and the Ogurcovna River. The snapshot shows evidenceCount is 1, and the recentEvidencePointers include \\\"6:1.1.1.p3\\\". But the current batch's items are pointers 24:1.1.1.p21, 25:1.1.1.p22, and 26:1.1.1.p23. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check each item in the current batch. The task says to use only the current batch's content. Looking at the markdown of each item:\\n\\n- The first item (24:1.1.1.p21) talks about Znayka's book and Professor Zvezdochkin's reaction. No mention of Ponchik or the river.\\n- The second item (25:1.1.1.p22) discusses the academic discussion about the book. Still no Ponchik or river.\\n- The third item (26:1.1.1.p23) mentions Professor Zvezdochkin arriving and starting the discussion. Again, no relevant terms here.\\n\\nNone of the current batch items mention Ponchik or the Ogurcovna River. The snapshot's recent evidence pointer is from a previous batch, which isn't part of the current data. Since the current batch doesn't have any relevant mentions, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". Also, the user's task might be looking for evidence in later batches, but since the current batch has nothing, we can't provide new evidence. So the correct output is \\\"not_found\\\" with no new evidence added.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1143,\"completion_tokens\":389,\"total_tokens\":1532}}\n",
