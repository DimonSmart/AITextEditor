The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided the first batch of items. Let me look through the items.\\n\\nThe first item has a pointer \\\"7:1.1.1.p4\\\" and the markdown content talks about Pончик and his experiences with moths and the smell of naphthalene. There's a mention of Pончик's clothes being eaten by moths, but no mention of a professor. The text discusses Pончик's daily routine, the smell affecting others, and his isolation. \\n\\nI need to check if there's any reference to Professor Zvezdokhin here. The paragraph mentions Pончик's mother, but not the professor. The text is about his life in the house, the smell, and interactions with others. No mention of a professor. \\n\\nSince the first batch doesn't have any reference to Professor Zvezdokhin, the evidence count remains zero. The decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there might be more batches to check. The user hasn't reached the last batch yet, so scanning should continue.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":801,\"completion_tokens\":254,\"total_tokens\":1055}}\n",
