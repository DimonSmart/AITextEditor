The task is to find the first mention of Professor Zvezdokhin in the text, excluding headers. The user provided the first batch of items. Looking at the items, there's only one paragraph here. The paragraph talks about the inhabitants of the Sun City helping the little people from the Flower City with construction, mentioning Engineer Klyepka's factory. The paragraph doesn't mention Professor Zvezdokhin at all. Since there's no evidence in this batch, the decision should be 'continue' because there might be more batches coming. The newEvidence array will be empty. So the JSON should have decision 'continue' and newEvidence as an empty list.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":694,\"completion_tokens\":157,\"total_tokens\":851}}\n",
