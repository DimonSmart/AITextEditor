The goal is to find the first dialogue between two named characters, and the context mentions looking for paragraphs with dialogue markers like quotes or dashes. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so once we find one, we should set the decision to \\\"done\\\".\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, there are two paragraphs. The first one (8:1.1.1.p5) talks about Znayka meeting the scientists Fuxiya and Selodka. The second paragraph (9:1.1.1.p6) describes Znayka's return and his stories. \\n\\nI need to check if there's any dialogue in these paragraphs. The first paragraph mentions that Znayka and his companions made observations, but there's no direct dialogue. The second paragraph talks about Znayka's stories but again, no quotes or dialogue markers. \\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me read again. The first paragraph has \\\"Знайка тоже включился в работу по постройке космической ракеты и, когда ракета была готова, совершил с Фуксией и Селёдочкой межпланетное путешествие.\\\" That's a narrative, not dialogue. The second paragraph mentions \\\"его рассказы очень заинтересовали всех, и особенно астронома Стекляшкина,\\\" but again, no dialogue. \\n\\nHmm, maybe there's no dialogue in these paragraphs. The task says to use only the current batch, and if there's no evidence, the decision should be \\\"not_found\\\". But the user might expect that there's a dialogue somewhere. Wait, maybe the example given in the task's context includes dialogue markers. Let me check the input again. The user provided the batch items, and in the first paragraph, there's a mention of \\\"на Луне воздуха нет, и, чтоб не задохнуться, всегда надо брать с собой запас воздуха.\\\" That's a statement, not dialogue. \\n\\nSo, after scanning both paragraphs, there's no dialogue between two named characters. Therefore, the correct decision is \\\"not_found\\\" since no evidence meets the criteria.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1306,\"completion_tokens\":476,\"total_tokens\":1782}}\n",
