The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters and name them. So far, I've been using keyword cursors to search for terms like \\\"said,\\\" \\\"dialogue,\\\" etc., but haven't found any dialogues yet. Then I switched to reading all paragraphs, but the text so far is mostly narrative without direct dialogues between named characters.\\n\\nLooking at the latest response, the paragraph starting at 14:1.1.1.p11 has \\\"Вулканисты говорили:\\\" which translates to \\\"The vulcanists said:\\\" This seems like the start of a dialogue. But I need to check if there's a named character mentioned here. The term \\\"вулканисты\\\" refers to the vulcanists, which is a group, not a named character. The previous mentions of characters are Знайка (Znayka), Фуксия (Fuksiya), and Селёдочка (Selyodka), but the dialogue here is between the vulcanists and possibly others, but not two named individuals.\\n\\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the earlier paragraphs again. The first mention of a dialogue is when Знайка talks about the moon's surface, but that's a monologue. The user needs two named characters. Maybe the dialogue starts in the next paragraphs. Let me continue reading the next batch to see if there's a direct conversation between two named characters.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_po3gatjk\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-read_cursor_batch\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"all_paragraphs\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":5228,\"completion_tokens\":332,\"total_tokens\":5560}}\n",
