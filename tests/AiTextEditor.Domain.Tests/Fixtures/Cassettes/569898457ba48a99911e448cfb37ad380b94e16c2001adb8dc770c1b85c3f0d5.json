The task is to check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different. Then return the names and the dialogue text.\\n\\nFirst, I need to look at the current batch items. The batch has three paragraphs. Let's check each one.\\n\\nFirst item: pointer \\\"75:1.1.1.p72\\\", markdown \\\"– Долой!\\\". This starts with a dash, not a character name followed by a colon. So maybe it's a dialogue, but the speaker isn't named here. The dash might indicate a speaker, but the task says \\\"starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So maybe the dash is part of the dialogue, but the name isn't present here. So this might not count.\\n\\nSecond item: pointer \\\"76:1.1.1.p73\\\", markdown \\\"Двое коротышек снова бросились на трибуну, один схватил Звёздочкина за шиворот, другой за ноги, и поволокли его прямо на улицу. Там его посадили в скверике на траву и сказали:\\\". This is a narrative paragraph, not starting with a name and colon. It ends with \\\"сказали:\\\", which might be leading into dialogue, but the actual dialogue starts in the next paragraph.\\n\\nThird item: pointer \\\"77:1.1.1.p74\\\", markdown \\\"– Вот когда полетишь на Луну, будешь выступать на трибуне, а сейчас пока посиди здесь на травке.\\\" Again, starts with a dash. So the dialogue here is probably part of the previous \\\"сказали:\\\" but the actual speaker isn't named here. The dash might be used for dialogue, but there's no character name before the colon or dash.\\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar\\\". So for example, \\\"Иван: Hello\\\" or \\\"Иван: Hello\\\" or maybe \\\"Иван - Hello\\\" but the task says colon or similar. So maybe a dash could be considered similar, but the name has to come first. But in the current batch, the paragraphs start with a dash, but there's no name before the dash. Like \\\"– Долой!\\\" – the dash is the start, but no name. So maybe the speaker is implied but not written. So perhaps these are dialogue lines without the speaker's name. So they don't meet the criteria.\\n\\nSo in the current batch, none of the paragraphs start with a character's name followed by a colon or similar. The first paragraph starts with a dash, but no name. The second is a narrative. The third starts with a dash again. So there's no consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a different character's name followed by a colon.\\n\\nWait, but maybe the \\\"–\\\" is considered part of the dialogue, but the actual speaker's name is missing. So maybe the task is looking for something like \\\"Иван: Hello\\\" but in the current batch, there's no such structure. So perhaps there's no evidence here.\\n\\nBut let's check again. The task says \\\"consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different\\\". So each paragraph must start with a name and colon (or similar), and the names in consecutive paragraphs must be different.\\n\\nLooking at the current batch:\\n\\n- 75: starts with \\\"– Долой!\\\" – no name before the dash.\\n\\n- 76: starts with \\\"Двое коротышек...\\\" – narrative, not a name followed by colon.\\n\\n- 77: starts with \\\"– Вот когда...\\\" – again, no name before the dash.\\n\\nSo none of these paragraphs start with a character's name followed by a colon. So there's no evidence here. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"continue\\\" because there's more batches, but no new evidence found in this batch.\\n\\nWait, but the task says \\\"If 'maxEvidenceCount' is provided in the task and you have found enough evidence (snapshot.evidenceCount + newEvidence.length \\u003e= maxEvidenceCount), set decision=\\\"done\\\". But in this case, maxEvidenceCount is null, so that condition doesn't apply. So the decision would be \\\"continue\\\" since there's more batches (hasMoreBatches is true), and no new evidence found.\\n\\nBut the output needs to have newEvidence as an empty list, and decision \\\"continue\\\".\\n\\nWait, the rules say: \\\"Do NOT add evidence for a pointer that appears in snapshot.recentEvidencePointers.\\\" But in this case, recentEvidencePointers is empty, but since there's no matches, newEvidence is empty.\\n\\nSo the JSON should have decision \\\"continue\\\", newEvidence empty list.\\n\\nYes. Because there's no evidence in this batch that matches the criteria. So the agent should continue scanning next batches.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":780,\"completion_tokens\":1051,\"total_tokens\":1831}}\n",
