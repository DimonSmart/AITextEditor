Now, I should run the agent on this cursor to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nWait, the tool response says \\\"search_cursor\\\" but no specific evidence yet. Maybe the first batch didn't have the mention. I need to call run_agent again with the same cursor to check the next portion. Let me do that. If the cursor isn't complete yet, there's more to scan. Once I find the paragraph with Fuchs' first mention, I'll note the pointer and stop.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_xhp8kbad\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first mention of Fuchs\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1328,\"completion_tokens\":191,\"total_tokens\":1519}}\n",
