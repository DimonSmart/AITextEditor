The user wants me to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. So first, I need to figure out how to detect a dialogue between two specific characters.\\n\\nThe previous step created a cursor named \\\"search_cursor\\\" with a filterDescription of \\\"true\\\", which means it's going to process all paragraphs. Then I ran the agent with a task to check for consecutive paragraphs starting with a character's name followed by a colon, and different names.\\n\\nThe response was \\\"No new evidence found in this batch. Status: More items available.\\\" So there's more data to check. Since the status says more items are available, I need to run the agent again with the same cursorName. The instructions say that if it returns \\\"not_found\\\" and \\\"Status: More items available\\\", I must repeat the run_agent call until I find the answer or the status is \\\"cursor_complete\\\".\\n\\nWait, in the previous response, it's \\\"No new evidence found\\\" but status is \\\"More items available\\\". So I need to call run_agent again with the same cursorName. Let me check the workflow again.\\n\\nYes, the critical part says: IF 'run_agent' returns \\\"not_found\\\" AND \\\"Status: More items available\\\", you must call run_agent again with the same cursorName. Do not stop. Repeat until found or status is cursor_complete.\\n\\nIn the last response, the decision was \\\"continue\\\", no new evidence, status more items available. So I need to run the agent again. Let's do that.\\n\\nSo next step is to call agent-run_agent again with the same cursorName \\\"search_cursor\\\" and same taskDescription. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. The cursorName is \\\"search_cursor\\\", taskDescription is the same as before: \\\"Check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different. If found, return the names and the dialogue text.\\\"\\n\\nYes. So I should generate another tool call for agent-run_agent with those parameters.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_d7a8285ae1334b908871b088\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Check for consecutive paragraphs where each starts with a character's name followed by a colon or similar, and the names are different.
