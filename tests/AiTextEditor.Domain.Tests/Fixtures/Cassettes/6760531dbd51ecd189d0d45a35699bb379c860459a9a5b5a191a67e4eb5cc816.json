The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names. I've tried a few different cursors already. First, I created a cursor for all paragraphs, then tried filtering for dialogue formats, then paragraphs with at least two named characters. But each time, the agent-run_agent returned not_found with more items available.\\n\\nHmm, maybe the filter isn't specific enough. The user mentioned \\\"two named characters,\\\" so perhaps I need to look for paragraphs where two different names are mentioned, especially in a dialogue format. Wait, maybe the initial filters didn't capture the exact structure. Let me think about how dialogues are structured. They might have lines like \\\"Name: Text\\\" or \\\"Name said, 'Text'\\\" or start with dashes indicating different speakers.\\n\\nMaybe the problem is that the previous cursors didn't account for the exact formatting of dialogues. Let me try creating a more precise filter. Instead of just looking for paragraphs with two named characters, maybe I should look for paragraphs that have dialogue markers, like colons or quotes, indicating different speakers. Let me adjust the filter to check for those patterns. Also, ensuring that the cursor reads through the document in chunks, and the agent can process each chunk to find the first occurrence where two named characters are involved in a dialogue. Let me set up the cursor with a filter that looks for paragraphs containing dialogue markers and at least two names. Then run the agent again to see if it finds the first dialogue.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_x7hi7rbk\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"agent-run_agent\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cursorName\\\":\\\"dialogue_cursor_v3\\\",\\\"taskDescription\\\":\\\"Find the first dialogue between two named characters and report their names\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1372,\"completion_tokens\":351,\"total_tokens\":1723}}\n",
