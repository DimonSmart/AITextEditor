Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to create a cursor to search for mentions of Professor Zvezdokhin. Since the user wants the second occurrence, I should set up a cursor that filters for any mention of that name. The filter should be stateless, so I can't use counters here. The cursor will process the document in portions, and the agent will scan each portion.\\n\\nI'll start by creating a cursor named \\\"search_cursor\\\" with the filter description \\\"All paragraphs containing 'профессора Звёздочкина'\\\". This ensures that every paragraph with the name is included. Then, I'll use the agent to run the task of finding the first mention. But since the user wants the second mention, I need to adjust. Wait, the agent might return the first occurrence, so I need to check if there's a way to get the second. However, the tool's description says that the agent scans the next portion, so maybe after finding the first, I can continue scanning until the second one is found. But the user wants the second mention, so perhaps the first time the agent runs, it finds the first, and then running again would get the second. Alternatively, maybe the agent can be instructed to find the second occurrence. But the parameters for run_agent don't mention counting occurrences. So maybe I need to create a cursor that captures all mentions and then find the second one in the list. However, the user wants the second mention, so I need to make sure that the cursor captures all instances. Let me proceed step by step.\\n\\nFirst, create the cursor. Then run the agent to find the first mention. Then run the agent again to find the next one. But the agent might not track the count, so the first run might return the first occurrence, and the next run would return the second. Alternatively, maybe the agent can be told to find the second occurrence. Wait, the parameters for run_agent include maxEvidenceCount, which is optional. If I set maxEvidenceCount to 2, maybe it would return the first two mentions. But the user is asking for the second mention, so perhaps the first run gives the first, and the second run gives the second. However, the agent might not know about the previous runs. So maybe I need to create a cursor that captures all mentions and then process the list to find the second one. But the user wants the second mention, so I need to make sure that the cursor is set up correctly. Let me start by creating the cursor and then running the agent to find the first mention. Then, run the agent again to find the next one. But the agent might not have a way to track the count, so the first run might return the first occurrence, and the second run would return the next one. Alternatively, maybe the agent can be instructed to find the second occurrence. However, the parameters don't allow for that. So the correct approach is to create the cursor, run the agent once to get the first mention, then run the agent again to get the second. But the user is asking for the second mention, so the answer would be the second item in the list of evidence items. However, the user wants the second mention, which might be in the same paragraph as the first. So I need to check the evidence items returned by the agent. If the first run returns the first mention, then the second run would return the second. Alternatively, maybe the agent can be told to find the second occurrence. But given the tool's limitations, the best approach is to create the cursor and run the agent twice. Let me proceed with creating the cursor first.\\n\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_i6ps412w\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"cursor-create_cursor\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"filterDescription\\\":\\\"All paragraphs containing 'профессора Звёздочкина'\\\",\\\"maxBytes\\\":1048576,\\\"maxElements\\\":1000,\\\"name\\\":\\\"search_cursor\\\"}\"}}]},\"finish_reason\":\"tool_calls\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1282,\"completion_tokens\":838,\"total_tokens\":2120}}\n",
