The user wants me to find all mentions of 'Фуксии' in the current batch. The task says to scan only the current batch's items and extract evidence. The snapshot shows that there's already 1 piece of evidence, and the recent pointer is 8:1.1.1.p5. But I need to check the current batch's items.\\n\\nLooking at the items provided: there are three paragraphs. The first one is \\\"– Верно! Правильно! Молодец, Знайка! Ура!\\\" No mention of Фуксии here. The second paragraph is \\\"Все захлопали в ладоши. Кто-то крикнул:\\\" Still nothing. The third one is \\\"– Долой Звёздочкина!\\\" Also no Фуксии. \\n\\nSo none of the current batch items have the term 'Фуксии'. The snapshot's recent pointer was from a previous batch, but the current batch doesn't have any matches. Therefore, the newEvidence array should be empty. The decision would be 'continue' because there's no new evidence to add. The user might need to check the next batch. Also, the maxEvidenceCount is 10, but since the current batch has no matches, the total evidence count remains at 1. So the output should have decision 'continue' and no new evidence entries.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":710,\"completion_tokens\":311,\"total_tokens\":1021}}\n",
