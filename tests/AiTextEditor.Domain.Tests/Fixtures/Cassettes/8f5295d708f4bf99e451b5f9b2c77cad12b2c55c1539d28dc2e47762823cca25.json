The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context specifies that the paragraphs must have direct speech markers and at least two named characters. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the first paragraph (24:1.1.1.p21), there's a mention of Professor Zvezdochkin expressing his anger about the book. However, this is a monologue, not a dialogue between two characters. The next paragraph (25:1.1.1.p22) mentions the professor proposing a discussion, but again, it's just his actions. The third paragraph (26:1.1.1.p23) starts with the professor speaking, but there's no other character mentioned here yet. \\n\\nWait, the task says \\\"dialogue between two named characters,\\\" so we need two characters talking. The first instance where two named characters are in dialogue would be the first occurrence. However, in the provided batch, the first paragraph has the professor talking, but not another character. The second paragraph mentions the professor and the Academy, but no dialogue. The third paragraph starts with the professor speaking, but maybe there's a dialogue here. Wait, the third paragraph's markdown says \\\"первое, что от него услышали, были слова:\\\" which translates to \\\"The first thing they heard from him were words:\\\" but there's no actual dialogue yet. \\n\\nHmm, maybe there's no dialogue in the provided batch. The user might have more batches, but since the hasMoreBatches is true, we need to check if there's any dialogue in the current batch. Since the current batch doesn't have any direct dialogue between two named characters, the answer would be \\\"not_found.\\\" But wait, the first paragraph mentions the professor and the Academy, but no dialogue. The second paragraph mentions the professor and the Academy again. The third paragraph starts with the professor speaking, but no other character. So there's no dialogue between two named characters here. Therefore, the decision should be \\\"not_found.\\\"\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1125,\"completion_tokens\":447,\"total_tokens\":1572}}\n",
