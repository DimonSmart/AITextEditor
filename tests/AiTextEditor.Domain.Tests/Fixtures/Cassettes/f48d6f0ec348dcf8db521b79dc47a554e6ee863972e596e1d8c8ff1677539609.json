The user wants to find the first dialogue between two named characters. The context mentions lines with dialogue markers or character names. The maxEvidenceCount is 1, so we need to find the first occurrence.\\n\\nLooking at the provided batch items, both are paragraphs. The first paragraph talks about Nезнайка's journey and mentions Кнопочки and Пачкули Пёстренького, but there's no dialogue here. The second paragraph discusses the construction projects and mentions инженера Клёпки, but again, no dialogue. \\n\\nSince there are no dialogue markers or direct conversations between characters in these paragraphs, there's no evidence to report. The decision should be \\\"not_found\\\" because the required dialogue isn't present in the current batch.\\n\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1265,\"completion_tokens\":175,\"total_tokens\":1440}}\n",
