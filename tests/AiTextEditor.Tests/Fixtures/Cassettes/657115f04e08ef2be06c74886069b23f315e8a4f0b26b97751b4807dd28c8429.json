Or maybe the book is large; we need to read more portions. The cursor_read_cursor_batch returned items only for first portion? It returned items for 1.1.1.p1 to p25. That is a lot.

We can run cursor_agent again with context \\\"Книга детская\\\" etc. But maybe the agent didn't find because we didn't provide enough context.
