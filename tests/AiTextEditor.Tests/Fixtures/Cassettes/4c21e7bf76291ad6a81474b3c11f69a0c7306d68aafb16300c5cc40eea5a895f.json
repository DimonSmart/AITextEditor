Let's try full scan cursor to read entire document and find the second chapter. But that might be large. We can use cursor_create_full_scan_cursor. Then read batches until we find the second chapter. But we need to find the ending of chapter 2. We can search for \\\"Глава 2\\\" and then read subsequent paragraphs until next heading. Let's try keyword cursor with \\\"Глава 2\\\". It returned no items. Maybe the heading is \\\"Глава 2\\\" but not matched due to punctuation. Let's try \\\"Глава 2\\\" with no punctuation. Already did. Maybe the heading is \\\"Глава 2.\\\" with a period.
